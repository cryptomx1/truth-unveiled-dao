# Phase XV: Collective Sentiment Ledger Initialization - Build Report

**Authority**: Commander Mark | JASMY Relay authorization  
**Implementation Date**: July 19, 2025  
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETE - All 5 modules implemented and integrated  

---

## Implementation Summary

Phase XV successfully implements the **Collective Sentiment Ledger**: a persistent, decentralized civic memory trail that binds trust signals, replay events, and temporal volatility snapshots into a distributed, queryable ledger. This marks the critical shift from internal pulse metrics to externally exposable, federated civic insight layers.

- Mobile-responsive grid layout with stable viewports

**Visualization Features**:
- Weekly grid layout with day-of-week labels
- Color gradients: green (high trust/low volatility) to red (low trust/high volatility)
- Activity intensity through opacity (no data â†’ high activity)
- Interactive hover with date, trust, volatility, and entry count
- Real-time data sync with SentimentLedgerEngine
