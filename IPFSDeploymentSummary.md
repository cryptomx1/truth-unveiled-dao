## üì° IPFS Integration Overview

The Truth Unveiled Civic Genome platform is fully configured for decentralized deployment on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) using Pi√±ata as the primary pinning service. This ensures global accessibility, censorship resistance, and permanent availability of the civic engagement platform.

### Current IPFS Configuration
- **Pinning Service**: Pi√±ata (configured and operational)
- **Environment Variables**: PINATA_API_KEY and PINATA_SECRET_KEY configured
- **Content Type**: Static React build with Express.js backend support
- **Distribution**: Global IPFS gateway network compatibility

## üöÄ Deployment Process

### Step 1: Production Build
```bash
npm run build
# Generates optimized static assets in dist/ directory
# Includes all 20 civic decks with 80+ modules
# Minified JavaScript, CSS, and asset optimization complete
```

### Step 2: IPFS Upload via Pi√±ata
```javascript
// Automated via configured Pi√±ata integration
const ipfsHash = await pinata.pinDirectoryToCid('./dist', {
  name: 'truth-unveiled-civic-genome-v1.0.0',
  metadata: {
    keyvalues: {
      version: '1.0.0',
      deploymentDate: '2025-07-19',
      authority: 'Commander Mark',
      platform: 'Civic Genome'
    }
  }
});
```

### Step 3: Content Addressing
- **Immutable CID**: Generated hash provides permanent platform access
- **Version Control**: New deployments create new CIDs while preserving history
- **Gateway Access**: Platform accessible via multiple IPFS gateway providers
