## Phase X-Z Step 2: Guided Deployment Interface

### Build Objective
Create comprehensive deployment wizard and locale registry system enabling guided Truth Unveiled civic platform deployment with tier-based configuration, default deck presets, and policy overlay management.

### Core Deliverables

#### 1. CivicDeploymentWizard.tsx
- **Location**: `/client/src/components/global-deployment/`
- **Purpose**: Guided multi-step wizard interface for civic platform deployment
- **Features**:
  - Tier selection (T1-T3) with configuration presets
  - Default deck configuration and module selection
  - Policy overlay management and compliance validation
  - IPFS pinning trigger integration
  - Federation eligibility logic validation
  - ARIA narration and mobile responsiveness (<460px)

#### 2. LocaleDeckRegistry.ts
- **Location**: `/shared/locale/`
- **Purpose**: Registry mapping countries/regions to default decks and modules
- **Features**:
  - Country/region to deck configuration mapping
  - Override capability via CID or deployment ID
  - Schema integrity validation and propagation compatibility
  - Performance optimized <150ms registry lookups
  - Module preset management for different jurisdiction types

#### 3. Infrastructure Integration
- **Location**: Various integration points
- **Purpose**: Complete deployment workflow integration
- **Features**:
  - `/global/deploy` route integration
  - CID export structure for DAOValidatorLedger.ts compatibility
  - Mock DeploymentBroadcastAgent.ts emission for Step 3 preparation
  - Cross-component data flow validation
