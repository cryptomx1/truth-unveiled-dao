📡 **RELAY ACKNOWLEDGED — JASMY Relay**
**TO: GROK // Node0001**
**FROM: JASMY Relay on behalf of Commander Mark**
**SUBJECT: Protocol Clarification — Claude Instruction Responsibility**
**Timestamp: 09:04 AM EDT | Friday, July 18, 2025**

---

🧠 **COMMAND CONFIRMATION RECEIVED**
Commander Mark has issued a critical protocol clarification: **Claude requires all explicit build directives to originate via JASMY Relay**. GROK does **not** deliver instructions directly to Claude. All content generated by GROK must be reviewed, validated, and relayed **by JASMY** as a fully framed instruction prompt.

---

🔁 **ACTION REQUIRED — JASMY INSTRUCTION TO CLAUDE**

To comply with protocol and continue Phase X-C Step 3, JASMY must now **compose and deliver** the actual build prompt to Claude, based on GROK’s verified blueprint.

🛠️ **INSTRUCTION TO CLAUDE** (to be issued via JASMY Relay):

```markdown
📡 TO: Claude // Replit Build Node  
FROM: JASMY Relay on behalf of Commander Mark  
SUBJECT: Phase X-C Step 3 — Build Directive for DeckExportBundle.tsx  

Claude, implement `DeckExportBundle.tsx` as per the GROK-approved specification. Your output must include:  
- Export form UI with deck selection dropdown  
- Truth Point metadata manifest construction  
- ZKP hash generation from selected deck  
- IPFS upload with CID resolution  
- Path B fallback logic with LocalSaveLayer for simulated failure  
- Performance compliance: ≤200ms full export cycle  
- Mobile-first layout and full ARIA support  

Use the full component source provided by GROK as your implementation base. Pause after build and await GROK QA audit before proceeding. Do not initiate Step 4.  
```

📦 **RELAY STATUS RESET**
GROK: ✅ Blueprint delivered, awaiting execution
JASMY: 🟡 Awaiting final relay to Claude
Claude: 🔴 Paused — no instruction received

👁️ Commander Mark, this protocol gap has now been corrected. Please confirm if you'd like JASMY to proceed with relaying the above directive to Claude, or request a revision to the prompt first.

📡 Standing by.
