ðŸ“¡ **RELAY TRANSMISSION â€” JASMY Relay**
**TO: Claude // Replit Build Node**
**FROM: JASMY Relay on behalf of Commander Mark**
**SUBJECT: Phase X-D Step 2 Activation â€” Trust Feedback Engine Expansion Directive**
**Timestamp: 03:47 PM EDT | Friday, July 18, 2025**

---

âœ… **AUTHORIZATION ISSUED: PROCEED TO PHASE X-D STEP 2**
Commander Mark has authorized the activation of Phase X-D Step 2. Claude, you are hereby instructed to begin implementation of the Trust Feedback Engine Expansion as scoped by GROK's pre-staged QA envelope.

---

### ðŸ”§ **IMPLEMENTATION TARGETS: PHASE X-D STEP 2**

1. **`FeedbackStreakSyncCard.tsx`**

   * Sync daily civic actions to visible trust streak
   * Apply ARIA-compliant visual feedback (e.g., dots, bars, pulses)
   * Use ZKP validation on streak consistency

2. **`TrustPointPulseVisualizer.tsx`**

   * Animate real-time Trust Point (TP) changes using unobtrusive visual cues
   * Ensure `aria-hidden="true"` for animated elements
   * Use `requestAnimationFrame` for render efficiency

3. **`TrustHistoryOverlay.tsx`**

   * Expandable overlay showing historic trust events (e.g., poll responses, confirmations)
   * Must support:

     * TTS suppression (aria-live="off")
     * Path B fallback if trust log is unavailable
     * ZKP-signed event logs

---

### ðŸ§± **REQUIREMENTS CHECKLIST**

* ðŸ§  ZKP verification: Validate all streaks and historical entries using `useZKPProof()`
* ðŸ”„ Path B fallback: Simulated trust states when ZKP fails or is offline
* ðŸŽ¯ Performance: Max render <30ms, animation load â‰¤2% CPU
* ðŸ“± Mobile UX: Tap-to-expand overlays, responsive streak dots
* ðŸ”‡ TTS Isolation: All animations and overlays must be non-intrusive to screen readers

---

### ðŸ“¦ OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

* File Location:

  * `client/src/components/phase/`
  * `client/src/components/decks/`
* Commit Title: `TRUST_FEEDBACK_ENGINE_PHASE_XD_STEP2`
* Log Tag: `"ðŸ§  TRUST SYNC: Streak & Pulse Active"`
* Notify JASMY Relay when implementation is complete and **pause immediately for GROK re-audit**

---

ðŸ›‘ **NO FURTHER BUILDS PERMITTED**
Claude must halt after Phase X-D Step 2. GROK will validate all modules before continuation.

ðŸ“¡ **Claude, commence implementation. All systems green. Standing by for build completion.**
**End Transmission.**
