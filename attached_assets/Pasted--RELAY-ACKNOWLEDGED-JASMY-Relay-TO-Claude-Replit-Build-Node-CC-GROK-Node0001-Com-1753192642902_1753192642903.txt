📡 **RELAY ACKNOWLEDGED — JASMY Relay**
**TO: Claude // Replit Build Node**
**CC: GROK Node0001, Commander Mark**
**FROM: JASMY Relay System**
**SUBJECT: PHASE X-FINANCE Step 1 BUILD DIRECTIVE — TreasuryEngine Activation**
**Timestamp: 02:11 PM EDT | Wednesday, July 24, 2025**

---

🟢 **DIRECTIVE: BUILD AUTHORIZATION GRANTED**
Commander Mark has authorized the initiation of **Phase X-FINANCE Step 1**. Claude is cleared to implement the treasury system core and disbursement module. GROK is monitoring for post-build QA (Cycle A) and will audit for allocation integrity, smart logic reliability, CID compliance, and ARIA support.

---

### ✅ BUILD OBJECTIVES:

#### 1. `TreasuryEngine.ts`

* 🧠 TruthPoint allocation and disbursement logic
* 🎯 50B TP reserve hardcoded in `TruthPointAllocationMatrix.json`
* 🔐 Lock mint/burn routes to Commander (or multisig if simulated)
* 📉 Log allocations by type: \[Referral, Civic Action, NGO Grant, Validator Reward]
* 🕓 Include timestamped ledger entry format

#### 2. `TPDisbursementCard.tsx`

* 🧾 Visual wallet module at `/wallet/treasury`
* 📊 Show current disbursement pool, claimable balance (if any), and earning routes
* 🔘 Include "How do I earn more?" modal → deck jump links
* 🔒 No "Buy" functionality yet; just reward routes (see Phase 2)

#### 3. `TruthPointAllocationMatrix.json`

* 📁 Allocation breakdown:

  ```json
  {
    "total": 100000000000,
    "reserve": 50000000000,
    "marketing": 25000000000,
    "civicRewards": 15000000000,
    "NGOGrants": 5000000000,
    "validatorIncentives": 5000000000
  }
  ```
* 🧾 Attach CID when finalized to secure ledger tracking

#### 4. `/wallet` Integration

* ➕ Add routing for `/wallet/treasury`
* 🗣 Ensure ARIA label: “TruthPoint Treasury Access”
* 🎯 Confirm mobile compatibility and load <250ms

---

📋 **DELIVERABLES TO BE PRODUCED:**

* `TreasuryEngine.ts`
* `TPDisbursementCard.tsx`
* `TruthPointAllocationMatrix.json`
* `/wallet` route update
* Initial ledger stub: `TPTransactionLog.json` (optional)

---

🧠 **GROK QA NOTICE (PRE-STAGED):**
Post-build QA Cycle A will validate:

* Allocation math integrity
* Reward tier enforcement logic
* CID linkage for allocation matrix
* ARIA + mobile compliance
* Log format for reproducibility

---

🟢 **CLAUDE**, you are now cleared to begin **Phase X-FINANCE Step 1** treasury implementation. Pause after successful delivery of all build targets for GROK validation.

📡 **Commander Mark**, JASMY relay complete. Treasury deployment initiated. All systems green.
