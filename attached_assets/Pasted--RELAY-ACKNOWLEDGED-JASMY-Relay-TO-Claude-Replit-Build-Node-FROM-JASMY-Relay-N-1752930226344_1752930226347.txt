üß† **PHASE XXVI ‚Äî CIVIC EVIDENCE ENGINE + PROOF VAULT INITIATION**

Commander Mark now authorizes **Phase XXVI**, deploying the **Civic Evidence Engine** and **Proof Vault System** ‚Äî establishing a cryptographically verifiable evidence log tied to mission completion, civic interaction, and cross-user validation.

This phase formalizes **proof-of-engagement trails** for use in civic resumes, platform reputation, DAO election eligibility, and dispute resolution.

---

### üß≠ **PHASE XXVI MODULE OBJECTIVES**

#### 1. `EvidenceCaptureEngine.ts`

* Generate a cryptographic ‚Äúproof capsule‚Äù at mission completion or key civic events
* Each capsule includes:

  * `eventId`, `timestamp`, `userHash`, `deckId`, `missionId`, `traceHash`, `evidenceDigest`

#### 2. `ProofVaultCore.ts`

* Secure storage layer for all `proofCapsule` entries
* Vault UI must support:

  * Search by event/mission/deck
  * Download as `.zkp-evidence.json`
  * Time-based filtering and integrity scan

#### 3. `ProofLedgerPanel.tsx`

* Evidence timeline UI with:

  * Status icons (‚úÖ Validated | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Sync | üîê Locked)
  * Tooltip previews with mission source and trust metadata
  * ARIA narration: "Evidence validated for mission: \[x]"

#### 4. `ProofExporterNode.ts`

* Export tool for civic resumes and DAO verifiers
* Bundle export:

  * `.civic-proof-bundle.json`
  * Includes signatures, capsule list, verification digest

#### 5. `EvidenceNarrationNode.ts`

* Screen reader and narration prompts:

  * "Proof capsule saved"
  * "Download complete"
  * "Signature validated successfully"

---

### üîê **SECURITY & LOGIC REQUIREMENTS**

* All capsules must contain cryptographic digest
* Capsule exports must include identity tier + mission context
* Vault must enforce integrity scan every 30 days
* All UIs must be ARIA compliant and <200ms update latency
* Exported bundles must simulate verifiable signature schema

---

### üìé **INTEGRATION DIRECTIVES**

* All capsules link to existing mission traceHashes and CivicIdentityMinter output
* Must allow bundle download from `/proof-vault` and `/missions/:id`
* At least 3 completed mission capsules required in test data
* Logs must include: `"üßæ Evidence capsule created ‚Äî mission: [id] | CID: [cid] | hash: [digest]"`

---

üö¶ **BUILD STATUS: GREEN**
Claude, you are cleared to initiate **Phase XXVI: Civic Evidence Engine + Proof Vault Deployment** now.
Implement all five modules and notify JASMY upon completion for QA Cycle A.

üì° **FORWARD TO CLAUDE** ‚Äî JASMY Relay standing by.
