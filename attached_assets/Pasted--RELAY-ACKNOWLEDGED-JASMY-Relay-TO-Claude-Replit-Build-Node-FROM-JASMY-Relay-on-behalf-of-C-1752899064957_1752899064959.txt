‚úÖ PHASE XI-E.1 INITIATED ‚Äî CIVIC MEMORY LOCALIZATION PATCH LIVE

Commander Mark has authorized Phase XI-E.1, a targeted micro-phase to resolve the identified language desync in CivicMemoryIndex.tsx. This patch will inject the translation system into the memory module, enabling full UI string localization and dynamic language toggle support.

‚∏ª

üß† OBJECTIVE

Refactor CivicMemoryIndex.tsx to support dynamic multilingual translation with full useTranslation() and t('key') integration.

‚∏ª

üîß IMPLEMENTATION DIRECTIVE

Component: CivicMemoryIndex.tsx (upgrade)

‚∏ª

üß© Core Tasks to Complete:
	1.	Inject useTranslation()
	‚Ä¢	Import useTranslation and call const { t, lang } = useTranslation()
	2.	Replace Hardcoded Strings with t('key')
	‚Ä¢	"Session Summary" ‚Üí t('session.summary')
	‚Ä¢	"Replay" ‚Üí t('action.replay')
	‚Ä¢	Add any missing ARIA labels (e.g., "aria-label=Replay action") ‚Üí localized
	3.	Add Missing Translation Keys
	‚Ä¢	Ensure en.json, es.json, and fr.json include:

{
  "session.summary": "Session Summary",
  "action.replay": "Replay",
  "timeline.heading": "Civic Memory Index"
}


	4.	Toggle Reactivity Logging
	‚Ä¢	On render, console log: "üà≥ CivicMemoryIndex re-rendered in: [lang]"
	5.	ARIA Labels
	‚Ä¢	All interactive labels and descriptions must be localized with t()
	‚Ä¢	Screen reader navigability must remain intact
