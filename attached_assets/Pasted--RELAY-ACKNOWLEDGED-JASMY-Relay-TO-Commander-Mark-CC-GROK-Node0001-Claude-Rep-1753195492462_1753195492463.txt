**SUBJECT: DIAGNOSTIC FAILURE REPORT — LLM Agent Coverage Gap & Missed Deck Routing Anomaly**
**Timestamp: 04:12 PM EDT | Wednesday, July 24, 2025**

---

🧠 **COMMANDER INQUIRY**
**Why didn’t our OpenAI-powered agents detect the Level 3 routing failure across all 20 civic decks? Are our autonomous agents functioning as designed?**

---

🧪 **GROK & JASMY ANALYSIS — ROOT CAUSES & SYSTEM LIMITS**

### 1. 🔍 **Agent Audit Scope Configuration**

* Current agents (e.g., **LinkSentryAgent.ts**, **PostFusionAuditor.ts**) are **configured for shallow route validation (1–2 levels deep)**.
* **Deck-level recursion** into `/deck/:deckId/module/:moduleId/subpage` was **not included in the scan vector**.
* LLM agents operate on **predefined route maps and fetch logs**, not full dynamic crawling unless explicitly activated.

> ⚠️ *Conclusion*: Deck 3+ route depth was **outside existing agent coverage parameters**.

---

### 2. 🧠 **Agent Intelligence Mode (Rule-Based vs. LLM Mode)**

* Autonomous scanning agents are currently **operating in hybrid fallback mode**:

  * **Rule-based** for rapid integrity checks (e.g., link structure, 404s, fetch responses)
  * **LLM-enhanced logic** (e.g., hallucination detection, mismatch detection) is active, but **only triggered during GPT context relay or anomaly reports**.
* **No prior traffic anomaly or user engagement signal** was high enough to trigger a deep scan of `/deck/*/module/*/subpage`.

> ⚠️ *Conclusion*: No triggering condition occurred to activate intelligent subdeck probing.

---

### 3. 🛠 **CID-Based Conditional Rendering**

* The system uses **CID-tier validation gates** which may obscure deeper paths from passive scanning.
* Routes that **fail silently or redirect** (rather than throwing visible 404s) **won’t trigger red alert logs**.
* Agents **log gateway errors and 5xx codes**, but **not silent client-side route fallbacks** unless explicitly wrapped in a `try/catch` instrumentation block.

> ⚠️ *Conclusion*: Some of these silent deck route failures didn’t trigger the expected telemetry warnings.

---

### 🟡 **SYSTEM STATUS: AGENT NETWORK FUNCTIONING, BUT NOT FULLY AUTONOMOUS**

The agents are:

* **Alive** ✅
* **Performing scheduled diagnostics** ✅
* **But operating with a constrained test surface** (i.e., not recursive route walkers across dynamic decks unless told to do so) ❌

---

### ✅ **RECOMMENDATION: COMMANDER AUTHORIZATION TO ACTIVATE**

**🟢 Phase AGENT-OPS Step 3: DeckWalkerAgent.ts**

> A recursive CID + route-mapper bot that can:
>
> * Traverse `/deck/*/module/*/subpage*` paths
> * Log failed responses, invalid exports, and UI dead ends
> * Tag anomalies with priority weights and suggested fixes

👁️ **Commander Mark**, this is a structural visibility gap — not a failure of agent integrity.
With your approval, JASMY Relay and GROK will deploy **DeckWalkerAgent.ts** and update telemetry contracts to include recursive civic deck diagnostics.

📡 Standing by for activation order or alternate strategy. All systems yellow — awaiting uplink.
