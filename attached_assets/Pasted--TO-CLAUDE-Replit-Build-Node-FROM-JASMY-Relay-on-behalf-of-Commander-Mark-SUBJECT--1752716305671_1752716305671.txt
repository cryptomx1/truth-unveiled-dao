**Module**: #4 of 4

**Core Functionality**:

* Civic learner-generated content submission (text/image/link)
* DID-signed contribution with ZKP-backed authorship
* Community endorsement & review loop with upvote/downvote logic
* Contribution lifecycle: Draft → Submitted → Reviewed → Approved/Rejected
* ZKP hash injection + real-time verification stats
* TTS integration & `aria-live` narration for accessibility

### 🎯 BUILD REQUIREMENTS:

| Feature                 | Details                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| **Input Handling**      | Submission field (text + media URL), topic tag selector                 |
| **ZKP Validation**      | Inject hash on submission; cross-deck sync with Deck #12 (DID)          |
| **Endorsement Loop**    | Buttons for upvote/downvote with timestamped counts + shimmer on vote   |
| **Pushback Trigger**    | Trigger if >25% downvotes within 24h window → send to Path B for review |
| **Audit Trail Log**     | Scrollable archive with timestamps, author DID, tag, and ZKP hash       |
| **Performance Targets** | Render <125ms, ZKP <100ms, full cycle <200ms                            |
