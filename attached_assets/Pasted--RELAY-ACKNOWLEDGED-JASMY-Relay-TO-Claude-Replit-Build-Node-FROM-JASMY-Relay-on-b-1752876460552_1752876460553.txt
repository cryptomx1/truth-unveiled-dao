📡 **RELAY ACKNOWLEDGED — JASMY Relay**
**TO: Claude // Replit Build Node**
**FROM: JASMY Relay on behalf of Commander Mark**
**SUBJECT: PHASE X-G STEP 2 AUTHORIZATION — ClusterNode.tsx Interactivity Directive**
**Timestamp: 07:21 PM EDT | Friday, July 18, 2025**

---

✅ **PHASE X-G STEP 2 INITIATED — INTERACTIVE CONSTELLATION CLUSTERS**

Commander Mark has authorized Phase X-G Step 2. Claude, your task is to activate **interactive behavior inside `ClusterNode.tsx`**, turning static clusters into responsive civic gateways. This step introduces hover tooltips, click/expand behavior, and real-time data overlays—without activating full navigation.

---

### 🌠 OBJECTIVE

Enhance each civic cluster with interactive behaviors that respond to hover, focus, and click. Activate visual + console feedback systems that prepare for future mission-guided routing (Phase X-G Step 3).

---

### 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION DIRECTIVE

**Component**: `ClusterNode.tsx`
**Location**: `client/src/components/navigation/`

---

#### 🔁 Core Features to Implement:

1. **Hover Tooltips**

   * On hover or focus:

     * Show cluster description box (e.g., “Feedback systems that let your voice be heard.”)
     * Delay: 250ms; Hide on mouseleave or blur
     * ARIA: `aria-describedby` linking tooltip to cluster node

2. **Click-to-Expand Behavior**

   * On click:

     * Expand orbit ring to highlight decks within that cluster
     * Console log: `"🌀 Cluster Expanded: Governance"`
     * Visually distinguish expanded state with glow or pulse

3. **TrustPoint Overlay Simulation**

   * On expand:

     * Show mock TP engagement count:
       `"💠 Engagement: 42,318 Trust Points"`
     * Console log TP total + ZKP tier (mocked)

4. **Tier Access Overlay**

   * Dim or lock decks the current tier can’t access
   * Tooltip on locked decks: “Upgrade tier to access this deck”
   * Use tier from simulated `useZKPTier()` hook (`citizen` default)

5. **Keyboard Navigation + ARIA**

   * Focusable clusters with `tabIndex=0`
   * `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` for expand state
   * Enter/Space triggers expansion

| Category      | Target                                     |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Commit Title  | `CLUSTERNODE_INTERACTIVITY_PHASE_XG_STEP2` |
| Push Location | `client/src/components/navigation/`        |
| Console Logs  |                                            |

* `"🌀 Cluster Expanded: Governance"`
* `"💠 Engagement: 42,318 Trust Points — Tier: citizen"`
* `"🔒 Locked deck: Consensus Layer — Upgrade required"` |
  \| UX Timing | Tooltip delay 250ms; expand animation ≤300ms |
  \| ARIA | Fully compliant with `role=button`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-describedby` |
  \| No Routing | Still log-only — no page transitions |

---

🛑 **REMINDER:**

* DO NOT enable actual navigation
* Simulate all overlays and metrics
* Tier = `"citizen"` only for this step

📡 Proceed with implementation, Claude. Notify JASMY Relay upon completion. GROK will begin QA re-audit.

**End Transmission — Step 2 is now active.**
