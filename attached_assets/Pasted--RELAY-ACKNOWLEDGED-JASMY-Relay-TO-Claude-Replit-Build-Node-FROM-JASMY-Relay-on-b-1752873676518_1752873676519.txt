📡 **RELAY ACKNOWLEDGED — JASMY Relay**
**TO: Claude // Replit Build Node**
**FROM: JASMY Relay on behalf of Commander Mark**
**SUBJECT: PHASE X-F STEP 2 AUTHORIZATION — CivicCompass.tsx Activation Directive**
**Timestamp: 06:32 PM EDT | Friday, July 18, 2025**

---

✅ **PHASE X-F STEP 2 INITIATED — BY ORDER OF COMMANDER MARK**
Claude, you are hereby authorized to proceed with the **implementation of `CivicCompass.tsx`** — the central mission orchestration layer that responds to onboarding selections, contextual inputs, and intelligent routing stubs.

This step builds directly on `CivicMissionOnboardingCard.tsx` and prepares for activation of the **Constellation Navigator**, tying mission intent to deck-level intelligence.

---

### 🧭 OBJECTIVE:

Implement `CivicCompass.tsx` to act as the civic mission router, intention memory node, and deck suggestion engine. This is a hybrid orchestration component—not a UI-only card.

---

### 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION DIRECTIVE

**Component**: `CivicCompass.tsx`
**Location**: `client/src/components/phase/`

---

#### 🚀 Core Features to Implement:

1. **Mission Context Handler**

   * Accepts selected mission from onboarding: `"representation"`, `"voice"`, or `"data"`
   * Uses mission to map to target cluster:

     * `representation` → Deck #13 (Governance)
     * `voice` → Deck #10 (Feedback)
     * `data` → Deck #1 (Wallet / Identity)

2. **ZKP-Aware Tier Filter**

   * Simulates ZKP role: `citizen`, `moderator`, `governor`
   * Filters deck access based on simulated tier:

     * `citizen` → Public decks only
     * `moderator` → Adds audit decks (Deck #8, Deck #9)
     * `governor` → All clusters unlocked

3. **Compass Routing Placeholder**

   * Based on mission + tier, console log:

     * `"🧭 CivicCompass Route → Deck #13 (Governance)"`

4. **Deck Preview Echo**

   * Console output sample preview (not rendered):
     `"📦 Preview → Deck Title: ‘Governance Dashboard’, Modules: [PolicyAppealCard, PolicySignatureCard]"`

5. **Telemetry Logging**

   * Log all context details:

     * Selected mission
     * Language (from LangContext)
     * Trust streak
     * ZKP tier
     * Suggested deck & fallback

### 📝 REQUIRED LOGS

* `"🧭 CivicCompass Initialized"`
* `"🎯 Mission Selected: voice"`
* `"🔥 Trust Streak: 5 days"`
* `"🌍 Language: ES"`
* `"🔐 ZKP Tier: citizen"`

🛑 **REMINDER**

* No UI output required
* No routing allowed
* All data must derive from input context or simulation
* Await GROK QA lock-in before any mission trigger goes live

📡 Proceed with implementation. Notify JASMY Relay upon completion. GROK will begin QA re-audit.
**End Transmission — Phase X-F Step 2 is now active.**
