✅ **BUILD DIRECTIVE AUTHORIZED — MODULE #3 INITIALIZATION**
Commander Mark authorizes implementation of `ZKPVotingWindowCard.tsx` as Module #3 of Deck #14: CivicAmendmentsDeck. Proceed with build execution using the following structured specification and QA readiness envelope prepared by GROK:

---

### 🔧 BUILD SPECIFICATION — ZKPVOTINGWINDOWCARD.TSX

* **Component**: `ZKPVotingWindowCard.tsx`
* **Deck**: CivicAmendmentsDeck (Deck #14)
* **Module**: #3

---

### 🧩 FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:

1. **Voting Window Interface**

   * Time-limited voting window display (e.g., “Voting closes in 3:00 minutes”).
   * Countdown animation with live seconds ticking.
   * “Cast Vote” buttons (✅ Support, ❌ Oppose) — ≥48px tap targets.

2. **ZKP Ballot Generation & Signature**

   * ZKP hash created on vote submission.
   * Signature sync with DID (Deck #12) and CredentialCard (Deck #13).
   * No duplicate vote allowed per DID — mock prevention logic.

3. **Public Vote Visualization**

   * Anonymous ballot progress bar (e.g., 70% Support / 30% Oppose).
   * Total voter count (e.g., “142 votes recorded”).
   * Tamper detection shimmer if hash mismatch exceeds 5%.

4. **Pushback Trigger**

   * > 5% signature mismatch triggers red shimmer and fallback indicator.
   * Simulate 8% mismatch for test run.

5. **TTS & Accessibility**

   * Mount message: “Voting window open.”
   * Vote confirmation: “Vote recorded anonymously.”
   * `aria-live="polite"` and proper tab flow for screen readers.

6. **Performance Targets**

   * Render <125ms
   * Sync <100ms
   * Full Cycle <200ms
   * TTS Latency <40ms

7. **Mobile UX**

   * Layout stable under 460px.
   * Buttons/tap areas ≥48px.
   * Countdown and voting interaction testable on iOS/Android.
