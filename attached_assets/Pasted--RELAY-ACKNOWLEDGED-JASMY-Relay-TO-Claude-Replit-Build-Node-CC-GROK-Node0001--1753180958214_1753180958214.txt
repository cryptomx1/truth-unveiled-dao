**SUBJECT: Phase X-FED Step 2 Authorization ‚Äî Federation Proposal Lifecycle & ZKP Overlay**
**Timestamp: 07:50 AM EDT | Wednesday, July 24, 2025**

---

‚úÖ **AUTHORIZATION GRANTED ‚Äî PHASE X-FED STEP 2**
Commander Mark hereby authorizes the execution of Phase X-FED Step 2: **Federation Proposal Lifecycle & ZKP Overlay Integration**. This phase extends the Federation DAO framework by enabling genesis badgeholders to submit, verify, vote on, and audit proposals through a tiered, zero-knowledge-compliant proposal flow.

---

üõ†Ô∏è **IMPLEMENTATION DIRECTIVE FOR CLAUDE**

You are now cleared to implement the following:

### üì¶ MODULES TO BUILD

* `FederationProposalSubmit.tsx` ‚Äî ZKP-gated proposal composer (metadata + intent hash)
* `FederationProposalReview.tsx` ‚Äî Badgeholder review pane with real-time sentiment and reputation streak overlays
* `FederationZKVotePanel.tsx` ‚Äî Encrypted voting interface with TP-weighted consensus visibility
* `FederationProposalAudit.tsx` ‚Äî Final ZKP-verifiable result screen with DID trace and CID-linked badge verification
* Update `FederationRouter.tsx` with new `/federation/proposal/*` routes

### üìç INTEGRATION TARGETS

* CID-binding for proposals via `TruthCoins.sol` guardian map
* ZKP verification reuse from `/deck/2` and `/zkp/mint`
* ARIA and mobile compliance (‚â§460px breakpoint)
* Reputation and sentiment overlays from `/deck/10`
* DAO proposal anchoring via `DAOBroadcastEmitter.ts`

---

üìä **PERFORMANCE TARGETS**

* Proposal submission + confirmation: <250ms
* Vote encryption + relay: <300ms
* ZKP validation + result publish: <500ms

---

üìé **NOTES FOR GROK**
Prepare QA Cycle B for Step 2 audit upon Claude‚Äôs completion. Include 10 submission flows (5 valid/5 invalid), 8 vote simulations, 3 audit chain verifications, and 4 guardian mismatch traps.

---

üü¢ **CLAUDE, YOU MAY NOW PROCEED WITH BUILDING PHASE X-FED STEP 2 MODULES**
Pause immediately upon implementation completion and notify JASMY Relay for GROK validation.

**Timestamp: 07:50 AM EDT | Wednesday, July 24, 2025**
üì° Standing by for build confirmation. All systems green.
