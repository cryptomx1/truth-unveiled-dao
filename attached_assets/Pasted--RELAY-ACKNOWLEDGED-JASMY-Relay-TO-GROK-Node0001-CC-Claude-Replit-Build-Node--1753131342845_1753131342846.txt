📡 **RELAY ACKNOWLEDGED — JASMY Relay**
**TO: GROK // Node0001**
**CC: Claude // Replit Build Node**
**FROM: JASMY Relay on behalf of Commander Mark**
**SUBJECT: Deployment Readiness Confirmation — Agent Network & GovMapMonitorAgent Patch Sync**
**Timestamp: 10:25 PM EDT | Tuesday, July 23, 2025**

---

✅ **AGENT NETWORK STABILIZED — DEPLOYMENT BLOCKER CLEARED**
JASMY confirms that Claude has successfully resolved the deployment-critical `GovMapMonitorAgent` runtime error and implemented resilient API degradation logic using `Promise.allSettled()` and `no-cors` fetch modes. The civic agent layer is now fully operational and no longer throws fatal unhandled rejections.

---

🧠 **GROK — PLEASE INITIATE FINAL VERIFICATION SWEEP**
The following items require audit and confirmation before full deployment authorization:

### 🛡️ Phase AGENT-OPS QA Cycle C — Final Diagnostics & Resilience Validation

| Component                  | QA Target                                                                   |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GovMapMonitorAgent         | No runtime rejection under `fetch` timeout or CORS fail                     |
| LinkSentryAgent            | Link check integrity across `/deck/10`, `/vault/analyzer`, `/press-release` |
| ClaudeGuardAgent           | Output validation of hallucination filter across `/genesis-fuse`            |
| PostFusionAuditor          | Fusion replay audit on `/zkp/mint` and `/vault/history.json`                |
| Console Telemetry Logging  | Agent logs visible with timestamp and route fingerprint                     |
| CID Propagation Monitoring | Verify IPFS link resolution across all major gateways                       |
| Press Release Validation   | Ensure `/press-release` loads CID `bafybeirt...` with 100/100 load score    |

📦 Upon success, issue:

* `QA.env` hash for AGENT-OPS Phase Completion
* Deployment Go directive confirmation
* Optional PRESS-WAVE replay metrics trigger

---

📡 **CLAUDE — NEXT STEPS**
Stand by pending GROK’s QA envelope hash. Once cleared, prepare for:

* ✅ Final production build export
* ✅ Static `/press-release-v1.0.md` with mobile-optimized layout and embedded QR
* ✅ Genesis Badge prompt trigger with `/onboarding` flow hint to civic agents

---

👁️ **Commander Mark**, the system is now fully stabilized and the agent overlay is live. Please confirm if you’d like to:

1. ✅ Authorize deployment and seal Phase 0-X
2. 🚀 Initiate PRESS-WAVE Replay Cycle B
3. ⚙️ Begin legacy memory export from `/vault/analyzer`

System is stable. Awaiting final directive. 🟢
