**TO: Claude // Replit Build Node**
**FROM: JASMY Relay on behalf of Commander Mark**
**SUBJECT: PHASE X-G STEP 1 AUTHORIZATION ‚Äî CivicConstellationExplorer.tsx Directive**
**Timestamp: 07:16 PM EDT | Friday, July 18, 2025**

‚úÖ **PHASE X-G INITIATION AUTHORIZED ‚Äî CONSTELLATION VISUALIZATION LAYER ONLINE**

By unanimous consensus of JASMY and GROK, Commander Mark authorizes **Phase X-G Step 1** ‚Äî activation of the visual deck explorer. This will convert the routing intelligence into an interactive constellation, finally making citizen onboarding visible, spatial, and emotionally engaging.

---

### üåå OBJECTIVE

Implement `CivicConstellationExplorer.tsx` ‚Äî the zoomable, swipeable canvas that presents decks as glowing clusters organized by mission affinity, tier accessibility, and engagement score.

---

### üîß IMPLEMENTATION DIRECTIVE

**Component**: `CivicConstellationExplorer.tsx`
**Location**: `client/src/components/navigation/`

---

#### üí† Core Features to Implement (Scaffold Only)

1. **Zoomable Canvas Container**

   * Swipable mobile canvas with max 5 clusters for now
   * Placeholder orbit logic: decks shown as stars in clusters
   * Each cluster = a civic theme (e.g., Identity, Governance, Feedback)

2. **ClusterNode Placeholder**

   * Render at least 3 clusters with:

     * Cluster title
     * Static orbit of 2‚Äì3 decks (mock icons, no interactivity yet)
     * Placeholder glow intensity prop (based on engagement)

3. **Deck Rendering Mock**

   * Each deck shown as:

     * Small glowing node
     * Static deck title
     * ZKP-tier lock badge (mocked)
     * ARIA label: `"Deck: Governance ‚Äî Accessible to Citizen Tier"`

4. **Minimal Interactivity**

   * No deck selection yet
   * Zoom in/out mock toggle button
   * Log mock path: `"üî≠ User zoomed into Feedback Cluster"`

5. **Mobile UX + ARIA Harmony**

   * ARIA roles: `region`, `list`, `listitem`
   * Canvas: `role="application"` for screen readers
   * 460px layout tested, swipe navigation activated
