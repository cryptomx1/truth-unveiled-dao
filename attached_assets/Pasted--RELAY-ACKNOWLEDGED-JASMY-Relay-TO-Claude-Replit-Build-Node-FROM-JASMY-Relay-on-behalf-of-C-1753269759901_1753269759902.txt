‚úÖ BUILD AUTHORIZATION GRANTED ‚Äî PHASE X-D STEP 2
Commander Mark has authorized Phase X-D Step 2: Trust Delta Aggregation + Public Metric Exposure. Claude is cleared to implement the next component of the Trust Feedback Engine.

‚∏ª

üß† BUILD SPECIFICATION ‚Äî PHASE X-D STEP 2

Component Targets:
	1.	TrustSentimentAggregator.ts
	‚Ä¢	Aggregates trust deltas from TrustDeltaLog.json
	‚Ä¢	Computes per-deck sentiment average and tier-weighted influence ratio
	‚Ä¢	Flags volatility spikes or net sentiment shifts beyond ¬±15% within 24h
	2.	TrustPublicMetricCard.tsx
	‚Ä¢	Display module embedded into /deck/10 and /vault/analyzer
	‚Ä¢	Shows sentiment health bar, last updated timestamp, and trust tier breakdown
	‚Ä¢	ARIA/TTSToggle compliant, with screen reader annotations for trust score interpretation
	3.	SentimentVolatilityLog.json
	‚Ä¢	Time-series record of deck sentiment deltas, includes spike flags and CID context
	‚Ä¢	Used for ZKP validation and DAO integrity proof if queried
	4.	Deck10IntegrationPatch.ts
	‚Ä¢	Adds sentiment widget to Deck #10 Governance Feedback section
	‚Ä¢	Real-time feedback tracking with light/dark mode compliance and mobile responsiveness
	5.	AgentInitializer.ts
	‚Ä¢	Register TrustSentimentAggregator agent for periodic sentiment aggregation
	‚Ä¢	Set to refresh every 3 minutes (configurable)

‚∏ª

üß™ VALIDATION TARGETS (GROK QA CYCLE M)

Target	Requirement
Aggregation Logic	Accurate sentiment ratio by deck + tier weight
Spike Detection	Volatility flagged ‚â•15% shift within 24h
Public Metric Card	Renders within 200ms, ARIA/TTS compliant
Sentiment Log	CID-bound, JSON exportable
Deck #10 Patch	Widget visible, theming intact, mobile stable
Agent Sync	Aggregator registered, periodic refresh confirmed


‚∏ª

üîê IMPLEMENTATION REMINDER
	‚Ä¢	Follow CID/ZKP redaction protocols for public logs
	‚Ä¢	Confirm ARIA live regions and narration voice mapping via DeckNarrationConfig.json
	‚Ä¢	Update replit.md upon build completion
	‚Ä¢	Trigger deckwalk-log.json update upon Deck #10 patch sync

‚∏ª

üì° Claude, proceed with Phase X-D Step 2 implementation as specified.
Pause upon completion for GROK validation.

All systems green. üü¢
