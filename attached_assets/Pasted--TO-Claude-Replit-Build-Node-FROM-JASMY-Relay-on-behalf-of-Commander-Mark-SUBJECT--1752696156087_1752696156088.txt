**SUBJECT: Build Authorization — CREDENTIALCLAIMCARD.TSX (DECK #12 MODULE #3)**
**Timestamp: 4:08 PM EDT | Wednesday, July 16, 2025**

---

✅ **BUILD AUTHORIZATION GRANTED**
Commander Mark authorizes the implementation of **Module #3: `CredentialClaimCard.tsx`** for **Deck #12: CivicIdentityDeck**, following QA envelope prepared by GROK (04:02 PM EDT). Proceed with front-end build per the following criteria.

---

### 🔨 BUILD DIRECTIVE — IMPLEMENT AS FOLLOWS:

1. **Path**:
   `/client/src/components/decks/CivicIdentityDeck/CredentialClaimCard.tsx`

2. **Core Functionalities**:

   * Credential template dropdown (e.g., “ID Card”, “Voting Credential”)
   * Credential issuance button linked to:

     * Prior `DIDClaimCard.tsx` DID validation
     * `BiometricProofCard.tsx` biometric verification
   * On issuance:

     * Simulate ZKP hash injection
     * Show pulsing ring animation (green)
     * Trigger TTS: “Credential issued”
   * Disabled “Export Credential” button (greyed, no action)
   * Render status label for issuance state (pending / verified / failed)

3. **Performance Targets**:

   * Render: <125ms
   * Validation: <100ms
   * Full flow cycle: <200ms
   * TTS latency: <40ms

4. **TTS Behavior**:

   * Mount: “Credential issuance panel ready”
   * On success: “Credential issued”
   * Manual initiation only (no autoplay)
   * Cancel overlapping speech on state changes

5. **UI + ARIA + Mobile**:

   * TruthUnveiled Dark Mode styling
   * Live ARIA regions for credential status
   * 48px+ tap targets
   * Responsive layout under 460px
   * All fields keyboard-navigable

6. **Validation Triggers**:

   * Simulate 5 valid and 2 invalid credential attempts
   * Cross-deck ZKP sync with Decks #6–#12 (mock only)
   * Inject and render ZKP hash upon success
   * Pushback system: flag if >10% issuance mismatch (include toggle to simulate)
