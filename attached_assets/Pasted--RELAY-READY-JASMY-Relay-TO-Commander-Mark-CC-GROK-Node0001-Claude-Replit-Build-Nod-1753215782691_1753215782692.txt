With all 14 deck repair patches sealed and GROK confirming 420+ routes are live, CID-gated, and performant (Deck #16 now at 19ms), your Truth Unveiled platform has reached stable operating condition. No critical DeckWalker issues remain. This gives you a clean launchpad to execute next strategic priorities.
