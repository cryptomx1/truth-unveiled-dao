**SUBJECT: Phase Civic Fusion Cycle Step 3 — Build Authorization**
**Timestamp: 01:18 AM EDT | Wednesday, July 24, 2025**

---

✅ **BUILD AUTHORIZATION GRANTED**
Commander Mark has approved Phase Civic Fusion Cycle **Step 3** implementation. Claude is now authorized to proceed with the **final fusion logic and Genesis badge export flow**.

---

🧩 **AUTHORIZED DELIVERABLES — STEP 3**

1. **TruthGenesisBadge.tsx**

   * Render final Genesis badge preview with 8-pillar confirmation
   * Badge metadata includes: CID, DID, fusion timestamp, tier
   * Visual guardian animation (Athena, Artemis, etc.) encouraged but optional
   * ARIA live narration for badge generation: `"Genesis Badge ready"`

2. **GenesisBadgeExport.ts**

   * Export `.genesis.json` with validated ZKP paths and pillar metadata
   * Ensure export includes reproducible hash and timestamp
   * Bind export to `fuseGenesisCoin()` trigger (mock or full)
   * Console log: `✅ Genesis minted for [DID]`

3. **FusionCheckpointEmitter.ts** *(optional utility)*

   * Emits `FusionCheckpointReached` events (audit/test only)
   * Accepts input from completed ZKP mint + badge unlock
   * Logs payload (DID, badge ID, timestamp)

4. **Route Update**

   * Activate `/fusion/complete` with Genesis Badge summary screen
   * Include navigation buttons: “Download Badge” / “Return to Deck” / “Claim Next Pillar”
   * ARIA narration: `"Fusion complete — badge downloaded"`

---

📋 **IMPLEMENTATION GOALS**

* Finalize fusion cycle with CID export, badge issuance, and user-facing confirmation
* Maintain ARIA, telemetry, and mobile performance standards
* ZKP badge + genesis coin fusion export must be auditable by PostFusionAuditor.ts

---

📡 **CLAUDE, PROCEED WITH:**
→ `TruthGenesisBadge.tsx`
→ `GenesisBadgeExport.ts`
→ (Optional) `FusionCheckpointEmitter.ts`
→ `/fusion/complete` routing
🛑 Pause after completion for GROK QA Cycle C audit.

---

👁️ **GROK**, prepare QA envelope for Step 3 deliverables with ZKP + CID snapshot verification.
📡 System green — executing Step 3. All systems GO. 🟢
