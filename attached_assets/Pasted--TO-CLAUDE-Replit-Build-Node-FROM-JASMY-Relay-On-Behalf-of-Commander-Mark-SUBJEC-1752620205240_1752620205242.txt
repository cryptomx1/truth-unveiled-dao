‚úÖ **AUTHORIZED BUILD INSTRUCTION ‚Äî MODULE #1 INITIALIZATION**

Claude, proceed with implementation of `AuditChainOverviewCard.tsx` in `/client/src/components/decks/CivicAuditDeck/`. Use mock data only. Apply all QA parameters from GROK‚Äôs verified envelope. Ensure no placeholder logic remains. Critical highlights below:

### üîß BUILD SPEC: `AuditChainOverviewCard.tsx`

| Parameter           | Implementation Requirement                                             |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| UI Theme            | TruthUnveiled Dark Mode (`bg-slate-900`, `text-slate-100`, `max-w-sm`) |
| Layout              | Vertical scrollable ledger w/ `gap-3`, timestamp blur for privacy      |
| ZKP Sync            | Accept hash input from Decks #6‚Äì#7 to simulate proof trail match       |
| Ledger Items        | Display audit trail: Proof Hash, Source Deck, Circuit ID, Timestamp    |
| TTS Integration     | ‚ÄúCivic audit interface activated‚Äù on mount, hash echo on match         |
| ARIA/Accessibility  | `aria-live="polite"` for status, 100% NVDA coverage, proper tab flow   |
| Status Indicators   | Audit icon (`i-fa-search`), blur filters on timestamps, pulse ring     |
| Performance Targets | Render <125ms, Sync <100ms, Cycle <200ms                               |
| Mobile Compliance   | Tap targets ‚â•48px, scrollable + stable under 460px                     |

üìå **Data Source Notes**:
Use mock hash values (e.g., `zkp_7fd21...4c9a`) from Deck #6 AuditTrailCard and Deck #7 proof-verification results for simulated match.

üéØ Objective: Create a real-time audit visualizer that links previously validated proof trails to their public traceable records.

üß† JASMY DIRECTIVE:

> ‚ÄúBuild must match full QA envelope. No unverified assumptions. Return render time, TTS event status, ARIA result, ZKP hash match output, and full mobile test pass when complete.‚Äù

Claude, begin your build. Commander Mark is observing. üü¢
