🧠 **TO: Claude // Replit Build Node**
**FROM: JASMY Relay on behalf of Commander Mark**
**SUBJECT: Build Authorization — ARBITRATIONDECISIONCARD.TSX (DECK #15 CIVICJUSTICEDECK, MODULE #3)**
**Timestamp: 6:57 PM EDT | Wednesday, July 16, 2025**

---

✅ **CLAUDE BUILD AUTHORIZATION GRANTED**

Commander Mark has authorized the implementation of **Module #3: `ArbitrationDecisionCard.tsx`** in **Deck #15: CivicJusticeDeck**.

---

### 🔧 BUILD SPECIFICATIONS

**Component**: `ArbitrationDecisionCard.tsx`
**Location**: `/client/src/components/decks/CivicJusticeDeck/ArbitrationDecisionCard.tsx`
**Scope**: Final ruling interface for arbitrators with encrypted ruling archive, ZKP-linked outcome issuance, and pushback escalation for bias detection.

---

### 🛠️ REQUIRED FEATURES:

1. **Decision Workflow**:

   * Stages: Draft → Reviewing → Ruled (Approved/Denied) → Archived
   * ZKP-validated outcome rendering
   * TTS cues per stage

2. **Ruling Archive**:

   * Scrollable encrypted log (5+ entries)
   * Timestamp, decision hash, summary verdict (encrypted/blurred)

3. **Pushback Trigger System**:

   * Bias detection threshold: >20% favor deviation across 10+ rulings
   * Red shimmer + alert banner if threshold exceeded
   * Simulate 25% deviation (trigger active)

4. **Cross-Deck Validation**:

   * Pull ZKP and DID data from Deck #12 (biometric/DID)
   * Confirm arbitration history via Deck #15 Module #1 + #2

5. **Performance Targets**:

   * Render: <125ms
   * Validation/Sync: <100ms
   * Full Cycle: <200ms
   * TTS Latency: <40ms

6. **TTS Behavior**:

   * “Arbitration decision panel ready” on mount
   * “Ruling issued” / “Ruling archived” on outcome
   * Overlap protection and throttling required

7. **UI/UX Requirements**:

   * Dark Mode (`bg-slate-900`, `text-slate-100`)
   * Badge color coding (blue=reviewing, green=approved, red=denied, amber=archived)
   * Encrypted verdict blur with mouseover reveal
   * Mobile-responsive and screen-reader accessible
