üü¢ DIRECTIVE: IMPLEMENT PHASE TTS-CIVIC-ENHANCE STEP 1
Commander Mark has authorized full deployment of the Civic Genome TTS Engine System per the QA-approved spec. Proceed immediately with the following deliverables:

‚∏ª

üß† IMPLEMENTATION OBJECTIVES
	1.	Create TTSEngineAgent.ts
	‚Ä¢	Core agent responsible for scanning all decks/modules, maintaining TTS toggles, narration queue, and tone configuration per civic topic.
	2.	Add TTSToggle.tsx to All Modules
	‚Ä¢	Toggle per module and deck with hover description: ‚ÄúNarrate this section aloud‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Include ARIA roles and live region announcement.
	3.	Generate DeckNarrationConfig.json
	‚Ä¢	Deck-by-deck tone/speed presets, format:

{
  "deck1": { "tone": "formal", "speed": "normal" },
  "deck2": { "tone": "encouraging", "speed": "slow" }
}


	4.	Create TTSDiagnosticReport.json
	‚Ä¢	Report on:
	‚Ä¢	Toggle injection coverage
	‚Ä¢	Audio source routing (OpenAI / fallback)
	‚Ä¢	Zones with invalid narration metadata
	‚Ä¢	Latency benchmarks (<500ms target)

‚∏ª

üéôÔ∏è INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS
	‚Ä¢	Voice Source Hierarchy:
	1.	OpenAI TTS (preferred, GPT-4o voice)
	2.	Play.ht (fallback)
	3.	Browser native (last resort)
	‚Ä¢	Functional Logic:
	‚Ä¢	Narration auto-pauses on page switch
	‚Ä¢	Tone/mood adjusted via DeckNarrationConfig.json
	‚Ä¢	Privacy compliance: exclude CID/DID/ZIP/ZKP
	‚Ä¢	Narration queue supports max 3 jobs per deck
	‚Ä¢	User tone preference may be saved via localStorage

‚∏ª

üîê CONSTRAINTS AND STANDARDS
	‚Ä¢	Fully ARIA compliant
	‚Ä¢	No voice playback unless user-initiated toggle
	‚Ä¢	Support mobile layout <460px
	‚Ä¢	All narration events must log to TTSDiagnosticReport.json

‚∏ª

‚úÖ ON SUCCESSFUL BUILD

Upon completion, Claude must:
	‚Ä¢	Append summary to replit.md
	‚Ä¢	Update deck module UIs with toggle logic
	‚Ä¢	Notify GROK for QA Cycle H validation
	‚Ä¢	Export TTSDiagnosticReport.json to logs directory

‚∏ª

üëÅÔ∏è Claude, execute all steps under PHASE TTS-CIVIC-ENHANCE Step 1 immediately. GROK will validate post-build. All systems green.
