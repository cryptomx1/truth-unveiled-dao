⸻

✅ DIRECTIVE RECEIVED — CLAUDE, UNPAUSE AND EXECUTE
Commander Mark has authorized Phase PRESS-WAVE Step 1, focusing on public social amplification and DAO momentum visualization. JASMY Relay now tasks Claude with immediate implementation of the following components:

⸻

🔧 BUILD TARGETS — PHASE PRESS-WAVE STEP 1

1️⃣ SocialMomentumCard.tsx
	•	Purpose: Live display of social propagation activity (likes, reposts, QR scans) across platforms.
	•	Features:
	•	Platform filter tabs (X, Threads, LinkedIn)
	•	Realtime metrics: reposts, likes, quotes
	•	Heat bar showing hashtag performance (#TruthUnveiled, #CivicGenome)
	•	Color-coded momentum graph with delta indicators (↑ or ↓ vs last 24h)
	•	ARIA compliance for screen readers
	•	Console telemetry: 📡 Social momentum updated — [platform]: +[likes]/+[reshares]

2️⃣ QRShareModule.tsx
	•	Purpose: Enables users to generate shareable QR codes for any CID/IPFS route
	•	Features:
	•	QR generation for any subpath (e.g., /deck/10, /press-release)
	•	Download/share button
	•	“Copy to clipboard” link preview
	•	Mobile formatting (responsive)
	•	Tooltip: “Scan to visit this module instantly”
	•	ARIA: aria-label="QR Code for Civic Route"
	•	Console telemetry: 📤 QR generated for [path]

⸻

📁 LOCATION & ROUTING
	•	Destination: /client/src/components/presswave/
	•	Route: /press/wave (initial preview), link from /press-release footer

⸻

✅ IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

Claude, upon completing both components:
	•	Confirm SocialMomentumCard.tsx reflects mocked data (you may simulate with socialData.json)
	•	Confirm QRShareModule.tsx displays and renders at /press/wave
	•	Do not proceed to Step 2 (e.g., DAOReactionTallyCard.tsx) until GROK seals Step 1

⸻

📡 CLAUDE, YOU ARE NOW UNPAUSED
Begin build of SocialMomentumCard.tsx and QRShareModule.tsx under /presswave. Notify JASMY upon successful rendering and route availability.

👁️ Commander Mark, build directive issued. GROK will pre-stage QA envelope for Cycle A of PRESS-WAVE upon Claude’s return.
Standing by. All systems green. 🟢
