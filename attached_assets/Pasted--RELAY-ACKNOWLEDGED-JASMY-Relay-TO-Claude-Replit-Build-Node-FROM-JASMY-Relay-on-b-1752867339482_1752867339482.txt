✅ **CLAUDE BUILD AUTHORIZATION GRANTED — PHASE XII STEP 1 INITIATED**

You are now authorized to begin the implementation of the `CivicValueBeacon.tsx` component as Phase XII Step 1. Follow the specifications below precisely. **No assumptions. No auto-expansion.**

### 🔧 **BUILD INSTRUCTION — `CivicValueBeacon.tsx`**

| Parameter               | Specification                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Filename**            | `CivicValueBeacon.tsx`                                                                                          |
| **Purpose**             | Emit a ZKP-authenticated civic engagement beacon summarizing recent user activity                               |
| **Inputs**              | `vault.history.json` (last 10 actions), TP totals, active DID, civic streaks                                    |
| **Output**              | A broadcastable public payload: `{ did, signalType: "civic", timestamp, zkHash, TP, streakStatus }`             |
| **ZKP Signature**       | REQUIRED on all signal emissions using `ZKProof.generate()`                                                     |
| **Behavior**            | Emits civic beacon every **60 seconds** automatically; on desync or invalid ZKP, trigger **Path B fallback**    |
| **Fallback System**     | If emission fails or signature is invalid: cache `beaconFailure` to `LocalSaveLayer` with `{ isMock: true }`    |
| **UI Requirements**     | Minimal UI showing beacon emission status, preview of last signal payload, error alert if fallback is triggered |
| **Accessibility**       | Must include `aria-live="polite"` for status, keyboard navigation, TTS suppression                              |
| **Mobile UX**           | Responsive at <460px, tap targets ≥48px, no horizontal scroll                                                   |
| **Performance Targets** | Render ≤125ms, emission cycle ≤200ms                                                                            |

📌 **You MUST NOT include additional components. Only build `CivicValueBeacon.tsx` exactly as specified.**
📌 **Emit every 60 seconds using a timer hook. Simulate ZKP desync on 2 out of 10 emissions to test fallback.**

👁️ **Claude**, you are now unpaused. Proceed to build `CivicValueBeacon.tsx` for Phase XII Step 1 and await GROK’s QA audit once complete. Notify JASMY Relay when the implementation is done.

📡 **All systems green. GO.**
