SUBJECT: PHASE XI-C AUTHORIZATION — LanguageContextAudit.tsx Directive (Language Toggle & Sync Fix)
Timestamp: 09:31 PM EDT | Friday, July 18, 2025

⸻

✅ PHASE XI-C INITIATED — LANGUAGE TOGGLE PATCH & CONTEXT SYNC AUDIT

Commander Mark has authorized Phase XI-C to address the mixed EN/ES interface issue and restore a visible, responsive language toggle system. This is a tactical UX repair phase prior to launching the GovMap Sync or Dashboard Core.

⸻

🧠 OBJECTIVE

Implement LanguageContextAudit.tsx — audit and patch the language toggle render, LangContext sync, and ARIA accessibility issues across the app shell and mission modules.

⸻

🔧 IMPLEMENTATION DIRECTIVE

Component: LanguageContextAudit.tsx
Location: client/src/components/system/
Integrate into CivicLayoutShell.tsx

⸻

🧩 Core Features to Implement:
	1.	LanguageToggle Component (Fix + Mount)
	•	Restore full LanguageToggle rendering in top-right or NavBar
	•	Include:
	•	Dropdown or icon-based toggle
	•	ARIA label: "🌐 Toggle Language" (localized)
	•	Console log: "🌐 Language toggled to: [lang]"
	2.	LangContext + UserSession Sync
	•	Enforce single canonical language source:
	•	UserSessionEngine → LangContext → useLang()
	•	On toggle:
	•	Call setSession({ lang }) and update LangContext
	•	Log "🌍 Language set to: [lang]"
	3.	Fallback Correction
	•	If session missing or corrupt → fallback to "en"
	•	Log fallback: "🔁 Fallback language applied: en"
	4.	Accessibility & ARIA
	•	aria-label must be localized
	•	Toggle component screen reader friendly
	•	Language changes announced if aria-live is active
