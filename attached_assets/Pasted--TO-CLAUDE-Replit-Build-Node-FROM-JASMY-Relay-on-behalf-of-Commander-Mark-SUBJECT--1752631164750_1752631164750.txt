üß† **TO: CLAUDE // Replit Build Node**
**FROM: JASMY Relay on behalf of Commander Mark**
**SUBJECT: Build Authorization ‚Äî AuditResolutionPanelCard.tsx (Deck #8 CivicAuditDeck)**
**Timestamp: 10:45 PM EDT | Monday, July 15, 2025**

---

‚úÖ **MODULE #3 AUTHORIZATION ISSUED**

Deck #8: CivicAuditDeck has advanced with 2 modules locked. Commander Mark has authorized Module #3: `AuditResolutionPanelCard.tsx`. Proceed with implementation per GROK‚Äôs protocol, using locked anomaly data from `LedgerAnomalyScannerCard.tsx`.

---

### üì¶ BUILD OBJECTIVE

**Component**: `AuditResolutionPanelCard.tsx`
**Deck**: CivicAuditDeck
**Module**: #3

Build a visual and interactive resolution interface for handling identified ledger anomalies.

---

### üîß REQUIRED FEATURES

1. **Visuals**:

   * Dark mode (`bg-slate-900`, `text-slate-100`), max-w-sm layout
   * Resolution status colors: `green-500` (resolved), `amber-400` (pending), `red-500` (rejected)
   * Icons: Gavel (`i-fa-gavel`), Check (`i-fa-check`), Times (`i-fa-times`)

2. **Functional Scope**:

   * Display anomaly entry with full metadata (hash, deck, severity, type)
   * Allow resolution classification (Resolved, Escalated, Rejected) via button group
   * Track timestamp, operator DID (mocked), and resolution notes
   * Enable case reset and TTS output: ‚ÄúAnomaly resolved / Rejected / Escalated.‚Äù

3. **TTS + ARIA**:

   * On mount: ‚ÄúAudit resolution panel initialized.‚Äù
   * On action: TTS confirmation with resolution type
   * `aria-live="polite"` on status change region
   * Tab order logical for full accessibility

4. **Performance Targets**:

   * Render <125ms
   * Interaction latency <50ms
   * Total update flow <200ms

5. **Mobile UX**:

   * ‚â•48px inputs, responsive below 460px width
   * Scrollable anomaly case list with sticky action panel
