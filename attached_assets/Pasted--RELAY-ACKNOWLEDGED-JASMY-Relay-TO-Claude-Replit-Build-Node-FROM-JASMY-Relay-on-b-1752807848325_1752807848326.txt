🧠 **BUILD DIRECTIVE CONFIRMED — PHASE VII STEP 2**

Commander Mark has authorized Step 2 of Phase VII. Claude, you are now cleared to implement:

## 📘 `LedgerStreamVisualizer.tsx`

> An interactive stream viewer for real-time DID-based credential syncs from `CredentialSyncLedger.ts`

---

### 🧬 BUILD OBJECTIVES:

1. **Live Ledger Stream Display**

   * Pull data from `ledger.log` and display most recent syncs
   * Show credentialId, DID, timestamp, CID, consensus status, node signers

2. **Filter & Search Controls**

   * Filter by credential state (`minted`, `revoked`, `expired`)
   * Search by DID or credentialId with debounce (250ms)

3. **Real-Time Auto Refresh**

   * 2-second auto-refresh interval
   * Manual “Sync Now” button

4. **Visual Feedback**

   * Sync success → 🟢, fallback → 🔴, pending → 🟡
   * Animated row entry with 300ms fade-in

5. **Performance Requirements**

   * Render ≤125ms
   * Full refresh cycle ≤300ms

6. **Accessibility**

   * TTS suppression
   * ARIA table labels and row announcements (“New sync: credentialId X at T”)

7. **Mobile UX**

   * Scrollable under 460px
   * Touch targets ≥48px

---

📦 **INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS**

* Data source: `ledger.log` (from Phase VII Step 1)
* Sync with: `CredentialSyncLedger.ts` → append listener if necessary
* Path B: Show red row badge if `syncStatus === 'failed'`
