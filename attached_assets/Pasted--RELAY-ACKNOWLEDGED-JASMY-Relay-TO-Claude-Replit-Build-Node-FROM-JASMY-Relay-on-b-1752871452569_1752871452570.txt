📡 **RELAY ACKNOWLEDGED — JASMY Relay**
**TO: Claude // Replit Build Node**
**FROM: JASMY Relay on behalf of Commander Mark**
**SUBJECT: Scaffolding Directive — Civic Constellation Navigation System (Phase XI-A)**
**Timestamp: 04:19 PM EDT | Friday, July 18, 2025**

---

✅ **CLAUDE, YOU ARE AUTHORIZED TO INITIATE PHASE XI-A: INTERFACE SCAFFOLDING**

Per Commander Mark’s strategic directive and GROK’s full QA validation, you are instructed to begin scaffolding the **Civic Constellation System** as the platform’s primary navigation framework for all decks and modules (20–30 decks, 100+ modules).

---

### 📐 OBJECTIVE:

Create a scalable, responsive, and intuitive **navigation interface** that transforms overwhelming content into **guided civic discovery**. Your scaffold must implement GROK’s verified hierarchy and enable future injection of ZKP-gated filtering, voice support, and dynamic personalization.

---

### 🔧 SCAFFOLDING TARGETS

**🧱 Root Container**

* `CivicConstellationExplorer.tsx`

  * Canvas-based or grid-based explorer using placeholder cluster nodes
  * Zoom/swipe navigation container
  * Minimal viable state: 3–5 clusters, each containing 3–4 module placeholders

**✨ Cluster Component**

* `ClusterNode.tsx`

  * Represents a deck group (e.g., Identity, Governance)
  * Accepts props: `title`, `modules[]`, `engagementLevel`
  * Brightness/glow placeholder for engagement state

**🪐 Orbit Wrapper**

* `ModuleOrbit.tsx`

  * Visual orbit of module tiles around cluster node
  * Placeholder animation only — use static positions and responsive layout
  * `aria-hidden="true"` enforced by default

**🧭 Compass Interface**

* `CivicCompass.tsx`

  * Ask: “What’s your mission today?”
  * Routes response to mock-filtered cluster focus
  * Initial filter state logic only — no backend processing yet

**🧠 Voice Search Shell**

* `VoiceSearchInterface.tsx`

  * Scaffolding only: visual microphone icon, static transcript preview, result mock list
  * No API or speech-to-text wiring required in this phase

**📋 Registry Fallback**

* `RegistrySmartFilter.tsx`

  * Simple dropdown or segmented control filtering (e.g., by type, engagement)
  * Display as sidebar or modal fallback mode

---

### 🎯 REQUIREMENTS

* All components must exist in `client/src/components/navigation/`
* Use Tailwind for layout and spacing
* Enforce ARIA roles: `aria-hidden` for passive visuals, `role="button"` or `aria-label` for interactive clusters
* Include placeholder `<DeckPreview />` cards inside each orbit
* DO NOT include full deck/module logic — this is scaffolding only
* Implement light-mode toggle for future accessibility preference sync

---

### 📦 OUTPUT & COMMIT

* Commit title: `CIVIC_CONSTELLATION_SCAFFOLD_PHASE_XI_A`
* Push location: `client/src/components/navigation/`
* Log tag: `"🧭 NAV SCAFFOLD: Civic Constellation Online"`
* Pause immediately after scaffold is complete
* Notify JASMY Relay for GROK re-audit

---

🛑 **PROTOCOL LOCK**
Do not inject ZKP logic, voice handlers, or live data until approved in Phase XI-B. Your job is structural scaffolding only.

📡 **Proceed with scaffolding, Claude. JASMY Relay will await your build confirmation.**
End Transmission.
