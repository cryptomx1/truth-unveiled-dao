📡 **RELAY CONFIRMED — JASMY Relay**
**TO: GROK // Node0001**
**FROM: Commander Mark // via JASMY Relay**
**SUBJECT: ✅ Phase XXXII Authorization Granted — TruthCoins Fusion Engine Initiation**
**Timestamp: 6:18 PM EDT | Saturday, July 19, 2025**

🧠 **COMMANDER’S DIRECTIVE**
I, Commander Mark, hereby authorize the initiation of **Phase XXXII** with full backing. The TruthCoins fusion system shall now proceed from theoretical to functional, with all constraints—economic, symbolic, cryptographic, and gameplay—respected.

Begin construction of:
✅ `TruthFusionEngine.ts`
✅ Integration with `ProofVaultCore.ts`, `TruthTokenomicsSpec.ts`, and `TruthCoinsIntegration.ts`
✅ Replay artifact & CID trace validator
✅ Fusion oracle event toggle logic
✅ Dynamic multiplier system (e.g., trust streak, civic oracle)
✅ Genesis unlock conditions (8 coin proof, ZK replay, vault tier ≥ Governor)

📡 **RELAY INSTRUCTION TO CLAUDE**
Relay the following implementation directive to **Claude** with high priority:

🛠️ **TO: CLAUDE // Replit Build Node**
**FROM: JASMY // Relay Node**
**SUBJECT: Phase XXXII Step 1 Build Authorization — TruthFusionEngine.ts**
**Directive**: Implement `client/src/fusion/TruthFusionEngine.ts` with the following features:

### MODULE: TruthFusionEngine.ts

**Core Features**:

* `attemptFusion(cid: string, proofBundle: ReplayCapsule[])`:
  Validates all 8 civic pillar token proofs + CID matches + vault integrity hash.
  Burns required TP from user's balance (bonding curve enforcement).
  Emits event `FusionEventTriggered` with multiplier bonus if active.
  If valid → mints Truth Coin via `TruthCoinsIntegration.ts`, logs achievement.

* `canFuse(cid: string)`:
  Returns `true` if all 8 civic pillar achievements exist in `ProofVaultCore.ts` and CID is unlocked.

* `calculateFusionCost(currentSupply: number): number`:
  Implements bonding curve logic:

  * 0–1M coins: 5,000 TP
  * 1M–5M coins: 10,000 TP
  * 5M–10M coins: 20,000 TP
  * Above 10M: Fusion closed (unless Genesis).

* `isOracleEventActive(): boolean`:
  Returns `true` if civic oracle ZK-hash resolves to activation window (mock 24h boost).
  Applies +25% yield or -25% fusion cost during window.

* `mintGenesis(cid: string)`:
  Only if user owns all 8 Truth Coins + replayed all 8 pillar missions.
  Vault tier must be Governor+ to trigger.
  Once minted, tier escalates to `COMMANDER`, vault logs updated, rep +50 awarded.

**Mock Functions**:

* `simulateFusion(cid: string)` for testing
* `getFusionEligibilityProfile(cid: string)` — returns user’s fusion readiness

💾 **File Path**: `client/src/fusion/TruthFusionEngine.ts`
📎 Dependencies:

* `ProofVaultCore.ts`
* `TruthCoinsIntegration.ts`
* `TruthTokenomicsSpec.ts`
* `CIDTierMap.ts`

📡 **Claude**, build only what is listed. Pause after implementation for QA. Await JASMY and GROK validation before proceeding.
🧠 Claude, this is Phase XXXII Step 1 — Fusion Engine Initialization. You are authorized. Proceed. 🟢

👁️ **Commander Mark**, fusion system is now underway. GROK will audit post-build.
📡 Relay complete. All systems locked and synced.
**Timestamp: 6:18 PM EDT | Saturday, July 19, 2025**
🟢 Standing by.
