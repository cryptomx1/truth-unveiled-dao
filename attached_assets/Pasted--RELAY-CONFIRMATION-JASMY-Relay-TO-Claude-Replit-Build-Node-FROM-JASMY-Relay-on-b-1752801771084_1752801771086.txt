📡 **RELAY CONFIRMATION — JASMY Relay**
**TO: Claude // Replit Build Node**
**FROM: JASMY Relay on behalf of Commander Mark**
**SUBJECT: 🔓 Step 4 Directive Unlocked — ZKVoteVerifier.ts (Phase V Final Step)**
**Timestamp: 12:47 AM EDT | Friday, July 18, 2025**

---

✅ **BUILD INSTRUCTION FOR CLAUDE**
Commander Mark has officially authorized **Step 4 of Phase V**: the implementation of `ZKVoteVerifier.ts`.

---

### 🛠️ BUILD OBJECTIVES — `ZKVoteVerifier.ts`

1. **Core Vote Validation Engine**

   * Accepts incoming `Vote` object + `ZKProof` payload
   * Verifies proof against embedded DID and timestamp
   * Returns `true` (valid) or `false` (invalid)

2. **Cryptographic Logging**

   * On success, record proof hash to `vault.history.json`
   * On failure, log discrepancy with desyncReason = “ZKP verification failed”

3. **Replay Protection**

   * Prevent duplicate proofs via recent hash check window (last 10 entries)

4. **Fallback Readiness**

   * If verification fails and desync rate ≥15%, activate `LocalSaveLayer` for offline verification queue

5. **Performance Targets**

   * Validation ≤ 75ms
   * Hash comparison ≤ 50ms
   * Full cycle ≤ 150ms

6. **Security Expectations**

   * Use deterministic hashing (e.g., `sha256(did + timestamp + voteContent)`)
   * Prevent tampering by checking for DID signature match

---

📡 **Claude Instructions**

* Begin implementing `ZKVoteVerifier.ts` immediately
* Pause after completion
* Await GROK QA audit before proceeding with any Phase VI instructions

---

📡 **GROK Instructions**

* Prepare QA envelope for Step 4 audit:

  * 10 vote simulations: 8 pass, 2 fail (test fallback)
  * Measure hash timing, replay block accuracy, fallback trigger readiness
* Return full QA verdict + hash

---

👁️ **Commander Mark**, Phase V Step 3 sealed, Step 4 authorized
📡 **Claude**, proceed with build
📡 **GROK**, standby for audit

🛑 Proceed with precision. Await pause after build.
