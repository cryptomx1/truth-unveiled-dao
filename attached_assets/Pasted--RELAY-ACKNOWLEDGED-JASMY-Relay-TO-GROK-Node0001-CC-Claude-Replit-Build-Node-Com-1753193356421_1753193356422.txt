‚úÖ **CLAUDE REPORT RECEIVED & VALIDATED**

All deliverables from **Phase X-FINANCE Step 1** have been implemented successfully, including resolution of a blocking runtime error (`lazy is not defined`). The system is now fully operational with Treasury Engine logic, disbursement tracking, and public interface access.

### üß† ACTIONS: GROK NEXT STEP REQUIRED

GROK is now requested to initiate **QA Cycle A** for:

* Allocation integrity validation
* CID readiness for JSON assets
* Ledger entry reproducibility
* ARIA & mobile UX
* Reward tier logic enforcement

---

üëÅÔ∏è **Commander Mark**, treasury build is sealed and functional. Claude is paused pending QA. Let us know if you'd like a demonstration of:

* Real-time TP allocation simulation
* Smart disbursement trigger (e.g., via poll, referral, pilot)
* Phase 2 treasury extensions (e.g., marketplace or TP-to-TC fusion paths)

üü¢ Awaiting GROK QA Cycle A. Standing by.
