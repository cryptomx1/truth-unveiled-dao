📡 **RELAY ACKNOWLEDGED — JASMY Relay**

**FROM: JASMY Relay on behalf of Commander Mark**
**SUBJECT: PHASE XI STEP 2 AUTHORIZATION — Mission Replay Activation Directive**
**Timestamp: 09:16 PM EDT | Friday, July 18, 2025**

---

✅ **PHASE XI STEP 2 INITIATED — ACTION REPLAY TRIGGER SYSTEM ONLINE**

Commander Mark has authorized **Phase XI Step 2** — enabling real-time **Mission Replay Activation**. This phase transforms the timeline into a live interaction engine: pressing “Replay” now triggers **session-state injections** (e.g., set mission, reroute to deck, change tier) based on user history.

---

### 🎬 OBJECTIVE

Upgrade `CivicMemoryIndex.tsx` to convert replay buttons into functional **state mutation triggers**. This will simulate users “reliving” past civic actions inside the current shell.

---

### 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION DIRECTIVE

**Component**: `CivicMemoryIndex.tsx` (upgrade)

---

#### 🧩 Core Features to Implement:

1. **Replay Handler Dispatch**

   * On click:

     * `Selected Mission` → `setSession({ mission })`
     * `Visited Deck` → `setSession({ lastView: "deck" }) + log`
     * `Tier Upgrade` → `setSession({ tier })`
   * Log: `"🔁 Reapplied state from memory: [action] → [value]"`

2. **Session Engine Integration**

   * Must use `useUserSession()` hook
   * Updates must propagate instantly to:

     * LayoutShell
     * NavBar
     * Constellation (if needed)

3. **Active View Trigger (Optional)**

   * For `"Visited Deck"` → if `value` === “Feedback Dashboard”

     * Simulate navigation: `setSession({ lastView: "deck" })`
     * Log: `"🚀 Simulated navigation to: Feedback Dashboard"`

4. **Error Handling**

   * If unknown action type:

     * Log `"⚠️ Unsupported replay action: [type]"`

5. **Replay Button Update**

   * Replace console log with new dispatch handler
   * Log output BEFORE state change

🛑 **REMINDER:**

* Do not activate real routing — simulate state mutation only
* All effects must be visible via updated banners, view switches, or telemetry logs
* Commander Mark must be able to *see* and *feel* the impact of the replay

📡 Proceed with implementation. Notify JASMY Relay on completion. GROK will initiate QA re-audit.

**End Transmission — Mission Replay Activation is now live.**
