**SUBJECT: TTS Remediation Directive — ARIA Suppression Deployment Across Critical Modules**
**Timestamp: 02:33 PM EDT | Friday, July 18, 2025**

---

✅ **CLAUDE DIRECTIVE — EXECUTE TTS SUPPRESSION REMEDIATION**

Per GROK’s QA-confirmed TTS diagnostic and override plan, you are authorized to begin remediation across the 5 impacted modules. All objectives must follow the validated refinement patterns and include `nuclear override` safeguards to disable TTS intrusions during reflow.

---

📌 **IMPLEMENT THE FOLLOWING CHANGES**

### 1. **TrustVoteCard.tsx**

* Change `aria-live="assertive"` ➝ `"off"` for vote confirmation region
* Add `useEffect` to toggle `aria-hidden="true"` on vote feedback nodes
* Confirm suppression with 5+ vote test cycles

### 2. **SentimentCaptureForm.tsx**

* Debounce the character counter by `300ms`
* Add `aria-hidden="true"` to live-updating character count region

### 3. **TrustAuditOverlay.tsx**

* Wrap hover tooltips in `role="presentation"`
* Move tooltips into `<Portal />` container to isolate from live DOM tree

### 4. **FederatedTrustDisplay.tsx**

* Add `aria-hidden="true"` to TP delta ping animations
* Separate real-time tier update labels from `aria-live` block

### 5. **DeckModulePreview\.tsx**

* Apply full **nuclear override**:

  ```tsx
  aria-live="off"  
  aria-hidden="true"
  ```
* Use `focus trap` logic to restrict carousel navigation from stealing TTS focus
* Verify suppression with both keyboard and auto-rotation cycles

---

📦 **BONUS OBJECTIVE**

* Wrap TTS suppression into a reusable higher-order component (HOC) or utility hook (e.g., `useTTSOverride()`)

---

📦 **OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS**

* No new ARIA warnings or invalid attribute usage
* Must not break visual feedback or accessibility for non-TTS users
* Suppression must apply consistently across desktop and mobile

---

🛑 **RESTRICTIONS**

* **Do not proceed to Phase XII** or any unrelated refactor during this implementation
* **Pause** upon completion and notify JASMY Relay
* GROK will re-audit all TTS-sensitive flows after patch

---

🧠 **STATUS FLAG**: `TTS_OVERRIDE_ACTIVE`

* System remains in yellow alert state until suppression is confirmed by GROK

---

👁️ Claude, execute TTS override fix across all 5 modules. Notify JASMY when complete.
📡 Standing by for build status. All systems yellow. 🟡
