üì° **RELAY ACKNOWLEDGED ‚Äî JASMY Relay Online**
**TO: Claude // Replit Build Node**
**FROM: JASMY Relay on behalf of Commander Mark**
**SUBJECT: Phase XI Step 1 Build Directive ‚Äî RoleInfluenceCard.tsx**
**Timestamp: 11:56 AM EDT | Friday, July 18, 2025**

---

‚úÖ **BUILD DIRECTIVE: PHASE XI STEP 1 AUTHORIZED**
Claude, you are authorized to begin implementation of `RoleInfluenceCard.tsx` as Step 1 of **Phase XI**. The design and scope are based on GROK‚Äôs QA recommendation and Commander Mark‚Äôs authorization.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **BUILD OBJECTIVES ‚Äî ROLEINFLUENCECARD.TSX**

**Component Purpose**:
Display a dynamic role influence dashboard that shows how Civic Trust Tiers (Novice ‚Üí Architect) influence Truth Point distribution, decision weight, and referral trust across the system. Integrates with:

* Trust tiers (Synced from TrustAuditOverlay.tsx)
* ParticipationStreakCard.tsx for streak bonuses
* DID overlays for identity-aware routing
* TruthPoint reward graph and federated sync pathways

---

### üí° **FEATURE REQUIREMENTS**

1. **Tier-to-Tier Influence Display**

   * Influence Map: Novice ‚Üí Architect role trust impact by percentage
   * Visual tiers rendered as vertical progress bars or radial charts

2. **Cross-Role TP Distribution**

   * Dynamic TP bonus preview based on observer‚Äôs role
   * Aggregation logic for multi-deck reward sources

3. **ZKP Verification Integration**

   * DID-linked influence verified via ZKP chain
   * Signature toggle (optional for Citizens, mandatory for Governors)

4. **Fallback Activation**

   * ‚â•15% influence desync triggers Path B (`LocalSaveLayer` fallback)
   * Cache to `vault.history.json` with `isMock=true` flag

5. **Accessibility & Mobile UX**

   * <460px responsiveness, ‚â•48px tap targets
   * ARIA-live announcements for trust tier changes
   * Keyboard navigation and TTS suppression

6. **Performance Targets**

   * ‚â§125ms render time
   * ‚â§200ms dynamic update cycle (tier sync or DID change)

---

üìé **INTEGRATIONS**

* Sync with TrustAuditOverlay.tsx for real-time tier status
* Use vault.history.json for trust data fetch
* Fetch DID from global context (`didContext`)
* Feed outputs into DeckMissionCard reward logic

---

üß™ **GROK QA ENVELOPE WILL VALIDATE**

* Civic trust routing logic
* Tier-weighted Truth Point preview
* Signature enforcement by role
* Path B fallback logic
* Accessibility and render speed

---

üõë **CLAUDE STATUS**
Proceed with `RoleInfluenceCard.tsx` build. **Pause immediately** after implementation and await GROK QA audit. Do not proceed to Step 2 until GROK issues confirmation.

---

üëÅÔ∏è **Commander Mark**, GROK has prepped QA and Claude is now authorized to begin Step 1.
üì° **GROK**, initiate post-build QA audit after Claude completes Step 1.
üü¢ **Claude**, commence build. Await pause confirmation.
