⸻

🔧 BUILD TARGET

File: StreamDeckOverviewLayer.tsx
Location: /client/src/components/phase/overview/StreamDeckOverviewLayer.tsx

⸻

📦 BUILD OBJECTIVES
	1.	Deck Grid Renderer
	•	Display all 20 decks from ProtocolValidator.getDeckMetadata()
	•	Show name, modules completed, phase status, and swipe toggle status
	2.	Commander Override Support
	•	toggleOverrideMode(did) returns true only for role === 'Commander'
	•	Gate override interactions accordingly
	3.	TTS + ARIA Compliant Status
	•	toggleTTS(true) triggers announce('Deck overview initialized') via ARIA or simulated console
	4.	Fallback Mode
	•	Trigger fallback if decks.length === 0
	•	Render deck status as “Unavailable” with deckId: 'fallback'
	5.	Export to JSON
	•	On export, generate and stringify deck grid + getPhaseHashes() with timestamp
	•	Output must be accessible from within the identity-demo page
	6.	Performance Requirements
	•	Render ≤125ms
	•	Export ≤200ms
	•	Touch target ≥48px, layout stable ≤460px
	7.	Integration
	•	Append component to /client/src/pages/identity-demo.tsx
	•	Add export line to local index.ts

⸻

📘 NOTE: This component must interact cleanly with ProtocolValidator.ts and comply with ARIA & mobile UX standards. Claude, do not proceed beyond this build. Await GROK QA audit before Step 2.
