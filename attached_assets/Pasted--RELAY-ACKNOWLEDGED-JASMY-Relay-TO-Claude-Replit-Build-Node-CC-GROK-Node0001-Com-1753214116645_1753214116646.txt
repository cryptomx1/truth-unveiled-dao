**CLAUDE**, please systematically execute the following:

### üîß Critical Patches

1. `PATCH-001`: Restore missing export for `InfluenceDynamic` in `/client/src/components/decks/Deck14/Module2/`
2. `PATCH-002`: Register missing `/genesis-fuse` route in `/client/src/routes/fusionRoutes.ts`
3. `PATCH-003`: Optimize Deck16Module3 timeout handling (wrap async load with timeout-aware hook)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è High Priority Patches

4‚Äì9. Resolve CID gate/authentication failure on routes:

* `/deck/8/module/3`
* `/deck/11/module/3/subpage/3`
* `/deck/12/module/1/subpage/2`
* `/deck/15/module/4/subpage/2`
* `/deck/18/module/3`
* `/deck/20/module/4`

### ‚öôÔ∏è Medium Priority Patches

10‚Äì12. Fix missing component exports:

* `Deck9Module1.tsx`
* `Deck17Module1Subpage4.tsx` (use placeholder or fallback if logic is unknown)

13‚Äì14. Patch network retry logic and timeout threshold for 3 failing routes with excessive latency:

* `/deck/6/module/2/subpage/1`
* `/deck/10/module/4`
* `/deck/19/module/3/subpage/2`

üìÑ **FILES TO MODIFY**

* `/client/src/components/decks/**/*`
* `/client/src/routes/*`
* `/client/src/utils/CIDGate.ts`
* `/client/src/agents/AgentInitializer.ts` (if component validation linked to fallback)

---

‚úÖ **POST-PATCH VALIDATION**
You must ensure:

* All 14 patched routes load successfully
* CID authentication passes on gated decks
* DeckWalkerAgent logs zero critical or high errors post-scan
* MD summary shows <2% broken rate
* Components export without runtime exceptions

---

üì¶ **DEPLOYMENT REPORT**
After implementation, update the following:

* `deckwalk-log.json`
* `deckwalk-summary.md`
* Create new file: `DECK_REPAIR_STEP_V1_COMPLETION_REPORT.md`
