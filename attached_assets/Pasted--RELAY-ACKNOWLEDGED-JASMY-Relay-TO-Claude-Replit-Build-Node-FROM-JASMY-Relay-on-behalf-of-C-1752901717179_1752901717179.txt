‚úÖ PHASE XVI STEP 2 INITIATED ‚Äî REAL-TIME GOVERNANCE DATA LINKAGE ONLINE

Commander Mark has authorized Phase XVI Step 2, activating the live legislative synchronization layer and ZIP-code-based civic alignment system. This step connects constituent geography to real-time bill tracking, enabling personalized feedback zones and transparent governance overlays.

‚∏ª

üó≥Ô∏è OBJECTIVE

Implement the LegiSyncAgent.ts logic module and integrate ZIP-district mapping hooks into GovMapEngine.tsx.

‚∏ª

üîß IMPLEMENTATION DIRECTIVE

Primary Component:
	‚Ä¢	LegiSyncAgent.ts
	‚Ä¢	Location: client/src/agents/

Secondary Hook Injection:
	‚Ä¢	Extend GovMapEngine.tsx to use ZIP-linked legislative data simulation

‚∏ª

üß© Core Features to Implement
	1.	ZIP-District Mapping Module
	‚Ä¢	Hardcode mock ZIP ‚Üí District ID links:

{
  "20852": "8B",
  "20001": "3C",
  "22102": "5A"
}


	2.	LegiSyncAgent.ts ‚Äî Mock Live Bill Tracker
	‚Ä¢	Exports function: getBillsByDistrict(districtId: string)
	‚Ä¢	Returns array of 2‚Äì3 mock bills:

[
  { title: "HB203 - Civic Data Privacy Act", status: "In Committee", sponsor: "Rep. Lin" },
  { title: "SB108 - Voter Registration Modernization", status: "Active", sponsor: "Sen. Ruiz" }
]


	3.	Integration with GovMapEngine
	‚Ä¢	On district click:
	‚Ä¢	Fetch mock bills from LegiSyncAgent.ts
	‚Ä¢	Log output:
	‚Ä¢	"üìú Bills in District 8B:"
	‚Ä¢	"‚Ä¢ HB203 - Civic Data Privacy Act (In Committee)"
	4.	Telemetry + ARIA
	‚Ä¢	Output logs for each bill
	‚Ä¢	ARIA live region: "aria-live=polite" reads number of active bills aloud
	5.	Mobile Scaling + Performance
	‚Ä¢	Fetch/render latency <200ms
	‚Ä¢	No impact on frame rate during zoom or interaction

üõë REMINDER:
	‚Ä¢	This step uses mock data only ‚Äî no real-time API pull
	‚Ä¢	Phase XVII (LegiScan Integration) will activate full data feeds and constituent push alerts

üì° Proceed with implementation. Notify JASMY Relay upon completion. GROK will initiate QA re-audit.

End Transmission ‚Äî Phase XVI Step 2 is now live. üü¢
