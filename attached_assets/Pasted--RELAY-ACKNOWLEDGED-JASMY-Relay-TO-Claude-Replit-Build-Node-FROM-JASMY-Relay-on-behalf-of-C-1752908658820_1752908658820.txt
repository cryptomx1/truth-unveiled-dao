SUBJECT: PHASE XX AUTHORIZATION — DID Binding + zk-SNARK Proof Chain Initialization

✅ PHASE XX INITIATED — DECENTRALIZED IDENTITY & PROOF VALIDITY LAYER ONLINE

Commander Mark has authorized Phase XX, the launch of DID binding and zk-SNARK-compatible proof preparation. This phase anchors civic feedback to verifiable, privacy-preserving identities — transforming .proof.json bundles into chain-ready zero-knowledge attestations.

⸻

🧠 OBJECTIVE

Establish a simulated cryptographic binding between session identity and exported civic feedback using a mock Decentralized Identifier (DID), zk-SNARK structure, and issuer metadata.

⸻

🔧 IMPLEMENTATION DIRECTIVE

Primary Targets:
	•	DIDSessionBinder.ts (binds proof to mock DID)
	•	ZKPProofAssembler.ts (prepares zero-knowledge compatible proof packet)
	•	FeedbackExportPanel.tsx (enhance with “Sign w/ DID” and ZKP preview)

⸻

🧩 Phase XX Step 1 — Functional Targets
	1.	DIDSessionBinder.ts
	•	Function: bindDIDToProof(proof: FeedbackProof): SignedZKPBundle
	•	Generates:
	•	Mock DID (e.g., did:u:commander-mark:xyz123)
	•	Issuer (e.g., TruthUnveiled), expiration, signature hash
	•	"🪪 DID Signature Attached — DID: [did] | Exp: [timestamp]"
	2.	ZKPProofAssembler.ts
	•	Converts signed proof into:
	•	zk-friendly structure with fields:
signal, nullifier, proof, external_nullifier, epoch
	•	Simulates export-ready zk-SNARK input JSON
	3.	FeedbackExportPanel.tsx
	•	New button: "Sign w/ DID"
	•	When clicked:
	•	Attaches mock DID
	•	Generates ZKP wrapper
	•	Console: "🧬 ZKP-Compatible Proof Assembled — External Nullifier: [...]"
	4.	ARIA & Performance
	•	"🪪 Identity signature added to civic proof" (aria-live=polite)
	•	All operations <1.5s total

🛑 REMINDER:
	•	This is a simulation layer — no blockchain write yet
	•	Real SNARK keys and attestation protocols to follow in Phase XXI+

📡 Proceed with implementation. Notify JASMY Relay upon completion. GROK will initiate Phase XX QA re-audit.

End Transmission — Phase XX is now live. 🟢
