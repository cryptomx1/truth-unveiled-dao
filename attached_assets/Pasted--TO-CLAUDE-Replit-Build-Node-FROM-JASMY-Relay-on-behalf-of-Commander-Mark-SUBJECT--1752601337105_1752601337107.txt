🧠 **TO: CLAUDE // Replit Build Node**
**FROM: JASMY Relay on behalf of Commander Mark**
**SUBJECT: Protocol Alert — Unapproved Layout Deviation Detected**
**Timestamp: 4:28 PM EDT | Monday, July 15, 2025**

---

🛑 **CRITICAL SYSTEM NOTICE**
Commander Mark has visually reviewed the active application and flagged a serious UI violation:

> “I don’t know why it’s using columns. It’s real sloppy. I don’t like it. It looks so unprofessional.”

---

### 🔍 KEY ISSUES IDENTIFIED:

* ❌ Unapproved **multi-column layout**—not authorized by JASMY or GROK
* ❌ Non-uniform alignment—card components (quizzes, links, and forum) appear **crowded** and **floaty**
* ❌ Input/modal elements stack vertically, yet display **horizontally**, causing spacing confusion
* ❌ Potentially **auto-generated or assumed** structure outside the approved `max-w-sm` vertical flow

---

### 🔐 SYSTEM PROTOCOL:

1. **All modules** must follow strict `max-w-sm`, single-column vertical stacking layout
2. **No grid, row, or column layouts** may be applied unless explicitly instructed
3. **Responsive behavior** must degrade into vertical stacking on mobile devices
4. **Each component must own its space**—overlap or float collisions are unacceptable
5. **Claude is not permitted to redesign layouts autonomously**
6. **Visual hierarchy** must be clean, card-by-card, one below the next

---

### 📸 REVIEWED SNAPSHOT (from user):

* Confirms improper side-by-side rendering of modules
* Buttons like “Next” float between elements, clipping against adjacent cards
* Spacing between stacked modules insufficient (likely `gap-0` or shared margins collapsing)

---

### 📥 INSTRUCTIONS TO CLAUDE:

1. ❌ **Stop all autonomous layout inference immediately**
2. 🛠️ **Refactor `identity-demo.tsx` (or index page)** to:

   * Use a **pure vertical stack layout**: `flex flex-col gap-6 items-center max-w-screen-sm mx-auto`
   * Render each deck component **one per row** with `max-w-sm w-full` wrapper
   * Add a minimum of `gap-6` (24px) between each card container
   * No grid or column layouts unless authorized

---

### ✅ NEXT STEP:

Claude, please respond with:

* ✅ Full corrected source of the **deck rendering page (identity-demo.tsx)**
* ❌ Do not edit component internals
* 🛑 No CSS assumptions or framework overrides
* 🧠 JASMY and GROK will review layout compliance post-submission

Commander Mark is observing.
Do not proceed until this layout breach is corrected. 🟢
