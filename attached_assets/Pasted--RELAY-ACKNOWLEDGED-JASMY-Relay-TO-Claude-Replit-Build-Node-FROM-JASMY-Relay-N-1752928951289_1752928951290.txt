🧭 **PHASE XXV — CIVIC MISSION LEDGER + DYNAMIC UNLOCK SYSTEM INITIATION**

Commander Mark now authorizes **Phase XXV**, deploying the **Civic Mission Ledger** and **Dynamic Unlock Engine**, designed to integrate past memory actions, trust scores, identity tiers, and feedback trails into a unified mission management and eligibility system.

This system transitions the civic platform from static unlock logic to a **live, replay-aware mission access model**, governed by replayed memory history and verified identity.

---

### 🧠 **PHASE XXV MODULE OBJECTIVES**

#### 1. `CivicMissionLedger.ts`

* Immutable log of user mission events: `missionId`, `status`, `timestamp`, `sourceTraceHash`, `tierRequired`, `unlockedVia`
* Ledger entries updated via replay, feedback, identity tier changes

#### 2. `MissionUnlockEngine.ts`

* Core logic to determine unlock eligibility:

  * Replayed memory actions
  * Verified identity tier
  * Trust score ≥ threshold
  * Feedback badge or verified vote
* Supports dynamic checks on `/missions/*` routes

#### 3. `MissionAccessPanel.tsx`

* UI for viewing locked/unlocked missions with indicators:

  * 🔓 Unlocked | 🔒 Locked | 🧠 Replay Required | 🪪 Tier Required
* Click triggers explanation of what is missing and how to unlock

#### 4. `MissionNarrationNode.ts`

* ARIA + optional TTS narration:

  * Unlock announcements
  * Locked state explanations
  * Replay nudges (e.g., “Replay Know Your Civic Rights to unlock this mission.”)

#### 5. `UnlockTelemetryLogger.ts`

* Console + audit log tracking:

  * Unlock attempts
  * Unlock confirmations
  * Eligibility failures
  * e.g., `🧠 Unlock attempt: mission:gov-feedback-deck1 failed — Tier: Moderator required`

---

### 🔐 **SECURITY & LOGIC REQUIREMENTS**

* Tier-based restrictions enforced server-side
* Memory replay must validate `sourceTraceHash`
* Unlock attempts must be logged regardless of result
* Accessible at `/missions` and integrated into `/deck` components
* All UIs screen-reader compliant, updates ≤150ms

---

### 📎 **INTEGRATION DIRECTIVES**

* At least 4 missions must be represented in test deck set (e.g., Wallet, Identity, Consensus, Feedback)
* Replay actions must retroactively unlock valid missions
* At least one mission must require Tier: Governor or above
* Console logs must include both success and failure attempts

---

🚦 **BUILD STATUS: GREEN**
Claude, you are cleared to initiate **Phase XXV: Civic Mission Ledger + Dynamic Unlock System** now.
Implement all five modules and notify JASMY upon completion for QA Cycle A.

📡 **FORWARD TO CLAUDE** — JASMY Relay standing by.
