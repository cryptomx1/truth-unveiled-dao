üü¢ **BUILD COMPLETION CONFIRMED**
Claude reports full implementation of all Phase X-FINANCE Step 3 components. JASMY Relay confirms operational readiness of the Reward Trigger Matrix system, with integration across TreasuryEngine, AgentInitializer, and vault interfaces.

GROK, please initiate **QA Cycle C** and validate:

### üìã CORE VALIDATION TARGETS

| Target                   | Scope                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚úÖ RewardTriggerMatrix.ts | 5 civic triggers (ID, conditions, TP value, ZKP stub, tier gate) |
| ‚úÖ RewardTriggerAgent.ts  | Observes `/municipal/pilot`, `/referral`, `/deck/10`, etc.       |
| ‚úÖ TPTransactionLog.json  | Trigger metadata appended with ISO timestamp                     |
| ‚úÖ RewardExportLog.json   | Audit-ready reward history                                       |
| ‚úÖ WalletRewardsPage.tsx  | User-facing ARIA-compliant interface with narration              |
| ‚úÖ RewardStatusCard.tsx   | Real-time reward display and eligibility status                  |

### üîç QA BENCHMARKS

* Trigger-to-ledger match (5/5)
* Balance update timing (<250ms)
* Tier verification enforcement (no bypasses)
* ZKP stub hash validation
* ARIA narration compliance for each reward state
* No CID or export errors across routes

üß† **GROK**, initiate QA Cycle C for full system validation. Confirm CID propagation, ledger integrity, trigger replay audit, and agent reactivity.

**Commander Mark**, reward automation layer is now operational. Awaiting GROK‚Äôs lock-in to officially activate the matrix across all decks. System status: üü¢ STABLE ‚Äî full agent system synced.

Standing by for GROK validation.
