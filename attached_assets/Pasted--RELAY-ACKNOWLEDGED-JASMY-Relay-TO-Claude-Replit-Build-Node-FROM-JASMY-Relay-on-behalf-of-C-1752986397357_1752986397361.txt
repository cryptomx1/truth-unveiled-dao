📡 RELAY ACKNOWLEDGED — JASMY Relay
TO: Claude // Replit Build Node
FROM: JASMY Relay on behalf of Commander Mark
SUBJECT: Phase X-K Step 1 Execution Directive — Begin VaultAnalyzer.tsx + ReputationIndexEngine.ts Implementation
Timestamp: 05:32 AM EDT | Saturday, July 19, 2025

⸻

✅ IMPLEMENTATION DIRECTIVE ISSUED
Claude, you are now formally authorized to begin implementation of the following Phase X-K Step 1 components as instructed by Commander Mark and validated by GROK:

⸻

🛠️ BUILD TARGETS — STEP 1
	1.	VaultAnalyzer.tsx
	•	Fetch vault.history.json from IPFS for provided CID
	•	Filter and verify badge and certificate entries via ZKProof.verify()
	•	Display verified credentials with metadata, type, timestamp
	•	Handle async proof failures gracefully with console logging
	2.	ReputationIndexEngine.ts
	•	Fetch full credential history
	•	Calculate total TruthPoints with time-decay algorithm
	•	Assign tier per scoring logic:
	•	Citizen >50, Contributor >100, Moderator >200, Governor >500, Commander >1000
	•	Return { cid, score, tier, decay, timestamp } object
	•	Log: 🧮 Reputation Score Calculated — Tier: [tier] | Score: [score] | Decay: [X%]
	3.	VerifierRegistrySync.ts
	•	Validate proof for verifier.registry.json
	•	Simulate chain sync and log: 🔐 Verifier Sync Complete — CID: [cid]

⸻

🎯 PERFORMANCE TARGETS
	•	Vault rendering time < 200ms
	•	ZK proof verification ≤ 150ms
	•	Score + decay calc ≤ 250ms per CID
	•	Badge and certificate render tested against 10 entries, 2 failed proofs

⸻

🧠 NOTES FOR CLAUDE
	•	Do not assume prior context execution. Await explicit directive from JASMY Relay for every phase.
	•	Pause immediately after completing VaultAnalyzer.tsx + ReputationIndexEngine.ts — no further action until GROK completes QA and JASMY issues Step 2 authorization.

⸻

📡 Claude, proceed with implementation now. Await audit lock confirmation.
🔒 Commander Mark has issued direct execution authorization. No assumptions, no deviations.

📡 Standing by. All systems green. 🟢
