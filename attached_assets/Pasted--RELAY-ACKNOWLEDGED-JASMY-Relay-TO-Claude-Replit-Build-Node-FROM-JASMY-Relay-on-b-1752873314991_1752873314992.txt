📡 **RELAY ACKNOWLEDGED — JASMY Relay**
**TO: Claude // Replit Build Node**
**FROM: JASMY Relay on behalf of Commander Mark**
**SUBJECT: PHASE X-F INITIATION AUTHORIZED — CivicMissionOnboardingCard.tsx Directive (Step 1)**
**Timestamp: 06:17 PM EDT | Friday, July 18, 2025**

---

✅ **MISSION BRANCH SELECTED: PHASE X-F — INTEGRATED ONBOARDING INTELLIGENCE**
Commander Mark has officially authorized transition to Phase X-F, Step 1. Claude, you are instructed to begin the **Civic Mission Onboarding Intelligence** implementation — activating the first intelligent entrypoint for citizens based on streak history, preferred language, and deck engagement metrics.

---

### 🧭 OBJECTIVE:

Create `CivicMissionOnboardingCard.tsx` — a smart onboarding interface that personalizes a citizen's first civic interaction using language, trust streak, and intent prompts.

---

### 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION DIRECTIVE

**Component**: `CivicMissionOnboardingCard.tsx`
**Location**: `client/src/components/phase/`

---

#### ✨ Core Features to Implement:

1. **Multilingual Prompt Personalization**

   * Uses `LangContext.tsx` from Phase X-E
   * Civic welcome text + prompt: *“What is your mission today?”* rendered in EN/ES/FR
   * Dynamic ARIA label generation for language-specific screen reader intros

2. **Trust Streak Sync**

   * If `streakDays >= 3`, inject: *“Welcome back, your civic momentum is strong.”*
   * If `streakDays < 3`, show onboarding encouragement: *“Let’s begin your civic journey.”*

3. **Deck Suggestion Intelligence**

   * Uses lightweight rule-based logic:

     * If `lang === 'es' && streakDays >= 5` → suggest Governance Cluster
     * If `lang === 'fr' && streakDays == 1` → suggest Identity Cluster
     * Else → suggest Polling Deck (Deck 20)

4. **User Mission Selector**

   * Dropdown or segmented control:

     * “Understand Representation”
     * “Make My Voice Heard”
     * “Secure My Civic Data”
   * On selection, triggers navigation placeholder (`console.log(“Selected mission: [X]”)`)

5. **Animated Entry UX**

   * Fade-in or slide-in welcome with voice-over-ready heading
   * Respect `aria-live="polite"` in intro region (ARIA harmony enforced)

🛑 **DO NOT** activate real navigation logic — use placeholders for mission routing until Phase X-F Step 2.
📡 Proceed with implementation, Claude. Pause after build and notify JASMY Relay. GROK will begin QA re-audit on confirmation.

**End Transmission — Phase X-F is now live.**
