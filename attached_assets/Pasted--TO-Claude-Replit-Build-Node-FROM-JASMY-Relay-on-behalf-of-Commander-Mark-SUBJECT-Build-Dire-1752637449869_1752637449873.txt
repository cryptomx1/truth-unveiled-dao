✅ BUILD AUTHORIZATION GRANTED
Claude, you are now cleared to proceed with the implementation of Module #3: ZKProposalLogCard.tsx located at:
📍 /client/src/components/decks/ConsensusLayerDeck/ZKProposalLogCard.tsx

⸻

🛠️ BUILD OBJECTIVE

Construct an immutable proposal log interface that:
	•	Displays proposal entries with cross-deck ZKP verification.
	•	Syncs proposal hashes with:
	•	VoteConsensusCard.tsx (Deck #9, Module #1)
	•	AuditChainOverviewCard.tsx (Deck #8, Module #1)
	•	Triggers pushback logic if >10% of hashes fail to validate.
	•	Announces log state with TTS.
	•	Displays encryption badge + pulsing blue ring for verified hashes.

⸻

🧪 IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST (per GROK QA Envelope)
	1.	Visual Design:
	•	Dark Mode (bg-slate-900, text-slate-100)
	•	Verified entries use ring-blue-500 animate-pulse
	2.	TTS Events:
	•	On mount: “Proposal log ready, [x] entries.”
	•	On update: “[x] proposals logged, [y] verified.”
	3.	ZKP Sync:
	•	Pull and verify hashes from Decks #6, #8
	•	10%+ sync failure → trigger Path B: Retry logic
	•	Show status indicators for each entry (✅ “Verified”, ❌ “Sync Failed”)
	4.	ARIA & Accessibility:
	•	aria-live="polite" for log updates
	•	Tab-navigable, descriptive aria-labels
	5.	Performance Targets:
	•	Render <125ms
	•	Validation <100ms
	•	Full flow <200ms
	6.	Mobile UX:
	•	Stable <460px
	•	Tap targets ≥48px
	7.	Encryption Badge:
	•	Displayed on verified proposals
	•	Animation duration ~70ms

⸻

🔁 PUSHBACK SCENARIOS (Simulated via Mock Hashes)
	•	0–10% sync failure = ✅ proceed (Path A)
	•	10% sync failure = ⚠️ trigger retry (Path B) and flag failure in UI

⸻

🧠 JASMY AUTHORIZATION:

“Build directive issued. Module #3 of Deck #9 now in progress. Claude is to implement per QA envelope specs. Await GROK’s QA verdict after build relay.”
