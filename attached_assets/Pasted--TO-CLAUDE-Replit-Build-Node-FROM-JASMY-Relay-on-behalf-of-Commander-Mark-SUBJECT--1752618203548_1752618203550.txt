🧠 **TO: CLAUDE // Replit Build Node**
**FROM: JASMY Relay on behalf of Commander Mark**
**SUBJECT: Build Directive — ProofBoundVaultEntryCard.tsx (Deck #7 SecureAssetsDeck Module #1)**
**Timestamp: 9:14 PM EDT | Monday, July 15, 2025**

---

✅ **BUILD DIRECTIVE CONFIRMED**
Claude, per Commander Mark’s directive and GROK’s QA envelope, you are authorized to begin implementation of:

📦 **Component**: `ProofBoundVaultEntryCard.tsx`
📚 **Deck**: `SecureAssetsDeck` (Deck #7)
🧩 **Module**: #1

---

### 🛠️ IMPLEMENTATION SPECS (FROM QA ENVELOPE):

#### 🎨 **Visuals**

* Dark mode: `bg-slate-900`, `text-slate-100`, `max-w-sm`, `gap-3`, `p-4`
* Blurred previews for locked assets: `filter-blur-md opacity-50`
* Status icons: `i-fa-lock`, `i-fa-unlock`, `i-fa-image`, `i-fa-file-pdf`, `i-fa-audio`
* Status pulse rings: `animate-pulse ring-blue-500` (locked), `ring-green-500` (unlocked)

#### 🔐 **ZKP Verification & Unlocking**

* Accept mock ZKP: circuit ID + hash match against static Deck #6 audit entry
* Gate access with 3 states:

  * **Locked**: blurred + tooltip + lock icon
  * **Limited Preview**: semi-visible overlay
  * **Full Unlock**: asset content revealed

#### 🧠 **TTS + ARIA**

* On mount: “Vault access initiated.”
* On unlock: “Asset unlocked with ZKP.”
* ARIA: `role="region"`, `aria-live="polite"` on vault state updates

#### 🔁 **Audit Sync Hook**

* Accept incoming mock proof hash, match with `AuditTrailCard.tsx` static log
* On match, trigger unlock animation and update ZKP badge state

#### 📊 **Performance**

* Render time: <125ms
* ZKP unlock delay: 2.5s simulation
* Transition latency: <50ms for access states
* Fully accessible mobile layout: stable under 460px, ≥48px tap targets

---

🧠 **FINAL NOTE**:
Do not trigger placeholder logic. All components must reflect active ZKP Layer state. Any “proof unlock” must visually trace back to Deck #6 AuditTrailCard hash entry.

🎯 **CLAUDE BUILD AUTHORIZATION: GRANTED**
Begin work on `ProofBoundVaultEntryCard.tsx` and relay build log upon completion. JASMY will await your readiness checkpoint and push visual confirmation to Commander Mark.

🟢 Proceed.
