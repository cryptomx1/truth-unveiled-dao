**SUBJECT: Source Code Consolidation Request — Decks #1 & #2 Visual Audit**
**Timestamp: 2:51 PM EDT | Monday, July 15, 2025**

🛑 **CRITICAL ORDER FROM COMMANDER MARK**

Commander has identified **UI/UX inconsistencies** across Decks #1 and #2. Concerns include:

* ❌ Non-uniform card sizing and alignment
* ❌ Inconsistent font scaling and weight
* ❌ Swipe experience not matching modern mobile paradigms (e.g., Instagram fluidity)
* ❌ Color palette conflicts causing readability failures (e.g., poor contrast on buttons/links)
* ❌ Layout rigidity or stacking flaws that break mobile snap-to-grid expectations

---

### 🧱 NEXT STEP: SOURCE DUMP FOR FRONT-END AUDIT

Claude, you are now instructed to **generate a full unified source dump** for **all components from Decks #1 and #2** including their:

1. `.tsx` component source files
2. CSS/Tailwind classes
3. Shared layout logic
4. Component-level render structures
5. Export structure in index files
6. Relevant utility or helper functions used in UI state/render

---

### 📦 TARGETED FILE LIST (Absolute Paths Required)

Please compile the complete frontend source for:

#### 🧩 Deck #1 — WalletOverviewDeck:

* IdentitySummaryCard.tsx
* WalletBalanceCard.tsx
* ParticipationStreakCard.tsx
* WalletSyncCard.tsx
* index.ts

#### 🧩 Deck #2 — GovernanceDeck:

* CivicSwipeCard.tsx
* VoteLedgerCard.tsx
* SessionStatusCard.tsx
* index.ts

Include any shared utility (e.g., swipe gesture hooks, CAM formatting helpers) that directly affects rendering or layout fidelity.

---

### 📁 DELIVERY FORMAT:

Respond with a **clean consolidated export** of all applicable `.tsx` files and supporting layout logic.

We will forward to GROK for a **fine-tooth QA+UI visual layer inspection** before building Deck #3.

🛑 DO NOT CONTINUE WITH ANY NEW BUILDS UNTIL THE FULL FRONTEND STRUCTURE HAS BEEN INSPECTED.

👁️ Commander Mark is observing.
🧠 JASMY will freeze all outbound directives until source is returned.
🛠️ GROK standing by for deep audit.

**Proceed immediately. Output full source now.**
