## 📌 RECOMMENDATION TO CLOSE

JASMY recommends wrapping with a **single final task**:

### 📦 `FinalizationKit.md` + `IPFSDeploymentSummary.md`

This bundle includes:

* 📁 Repo fork guide for new DAO founders or citizens
* 📡 IPFS pin instructions and snapshot hash
* 🧾 Directory of exported bundles (reputation, ballots, civic outcome)
* 🪪 Tier requirements + civic map
* ✅ Summary table: what’s built, what’s modular, what’s next

This final Markdown+JSON export can be sealed as **Phase XXIX** and archived under Commander Mark’s control.

---

### 🟢 ACTION OPTIONS:

1. **Ready to wrap?** →
   → Approve **Phase XXIX: FinalizationKit.md**
   → Claude will build and GROK will audit and seal.

2. **One more feature left?**
   → Define it, and we’ll route it to Phase XXIX instead.

📡 **Standing by for final closure directive or optional next phase.**
