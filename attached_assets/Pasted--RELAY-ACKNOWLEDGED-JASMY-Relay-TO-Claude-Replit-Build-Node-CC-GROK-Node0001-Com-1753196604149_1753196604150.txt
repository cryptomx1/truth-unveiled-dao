📡 **RELAY ACKNOWLEDGED — JASMY Relay**
**TO: Claude // Replit Build Node**
**CC: GROK Node0001, Commander Mark**
**FROM: JASMY Relay System**
**SUBJECT: PHASE X-FINANCE STEP 3 — BUILD SPECIFICATION FOR REWARD TRIGGER MATRIX**
**Timestamp: 04:52 PM EDT | Wednesday, July 24, 2025**

---

✅ **DIRECTIVE RECEIVED: PHASE X-FINANCE STEP 3 INITIATED**
Commander Mark has authorized activation of the **Reward Trigger Matrix**, completing the TruthPoint lifecycle from allocation → utility → **automated civic recognition**.

Below is the full build specification for implementation. Proceed immediately and pause for GROK QA upon completion.

---

### 🛠️ MODULES TO BUILD

#### 1. `RewardTriggerMatrix.ts`

* A static registry of civic triggers (e.g., "Attend Municipal Pilot", "Refer a Citizen", "Complete Deck #10 Feedback")
* Includes:
  • `triggerId: string`
  • `actionType: "pilot" | "referral" | "streak" | "feedback"`
  • `TPReward: number`
  • `conditions: ZKP | DID | tier >= Citizen`
  • `description: string`

#### 2. `RewardTriggerAgent.ts`

* Autonomous observer that listens for civic trigger events emitted from routes like:
  `/municipal/pilot`, `/deck/10`, `/press/replay`, `/referral`
* Validates conditions using ZKP stubs or tier check
* Emits `RewardTriggered` event and writes to TPTransactionLog.json

#### 3. `RewardExportLog.json`

* Immutable, human-readable export of all triggered rewards
* Includes:
  • `timestamp`
  • `triggerId`
  • `walletCID`
  • `TPReward`
  • `validated: boolean`

#### 4. `/wallet/rewards` Route

* User interface to view:
  • Recently earned TruthPoint rewards
  • Status of pending triggers
  • Actionable rewards (e.g., "Claim TP for Municipal Participation")
* Includes `RewardStatusCard.tsx` component with ARIA narration

---

### ⚙️ SYSTEM INTEGRATIONS

* **TreasuryEngine.ts**: Reward disbursements drawn from correct tranche (e.g., 25B Marketing)
* **TPTransactionLog.json**: Append-only log with ISO timestamp
* **TPVaultVerifier.ts**: Sync earned balance after trigger
* **AgentInitializer.ts**: Register `RewardTriggerAgent`

### 📏 TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

| Target                  | Specification                                              |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| CID & Tier Verification | All trigger events gated by `DID` + `tier >= Citizen`      |
| ZKP Stub Integration    | Hash-based validation for actions (Phase XXVIII readiness) |
| ARIA Compliance         | Narration for `/wallet/rewards`                            |
| Performance             | <200ms route load, <250ms trigger process                  |
| Ledger Integrity        | ISO timestamps, no corruption on log append                |

🔄 **BUILD ORDER**

1. Implement `RewardTriggerMatrix.ts` and seed 5 sample triggers:

   * `MUNICIPAL_PARTICIPATION`, `REFERRAL_NEW_USER`, `DECK10_FEEDBACK`, `COMMAND_STREAK`, `TRUTH_MEDIA_UPLOAD`
2. Build `RewardTriggerAgent.ts` and register with `AgentInitializer.ts`
3. Enhance `TPTransactionLog.json` with reward trigger metadata
4. Create `/wallet/rewards` route and `RewardStatusCard.tsx` interface
5. Generate `RewardExportLog.json` for DAO audit
6. Pause for GROK QA Cycle C

📡 **CLAUDE**, commence build for Phase X-FINANCE Step 3. Await GROK QA lock after implementation.
🧠 **GROK**, QA envelope has been staged for post-build audit. Ready to validate CID sync, reward disbursement integrity, and agent logic.

**Commander Mark**, system green. Executing TruthPoint Reward Trigger Matrix.
Standing by for execution report. 🟢
