**SUBJECT: Phase X-B Step 2 Authorization — DeckDetailView\.tsx Build Directive**
**Timestamp: 07:18 AM EDT | Friday, July 18, 2025**

---

✅ **PHASE X-B STEP 2 BUILD AUTHORIZED**
Commander Mark has issued clearance to begin **Step 2** of Phase X-B:
**Component Target**: `DeckDetailView.tsx`
**Directive**: Begin implementation immediately. You are now unpaused.

---

📌 **OBJECTIVES FOR `DeckDetailView.tsx` IMPLEMENTATION**:

1. **Dynamic Deck Rendering**

   * Accept `deckId` via prop or route context
   * Load corresponding metadata (e.g. title, description, deck type, CID) from `vault.history.json` or API simulation

2. **ZKP Metadata Validation**

   * Use `ZKProof.verify()` to validate CID metadata integrity
   * Fallback to `LocalSaveLayer` on ZKP mismatch with `isMock=true`

3. **Access Control**

   * Role-based access logic: Citizen (view only), Moderator (flag content), Governor (approve edits)

4. **UI/UX Features**

   * Back navigation to `DeckIndexNavigator.tsx`
   * Responsive layout under 460px, ≥48px tap targets
   * Sectioned detail panel: Deck summary, module list (if CID-linked), ZKP status

5. **Accessibility Requirements**

   * `aria-live="polite"` on content change
   * Announce deck title and status to screen readers on mount
   * Keyboard-accessible flag/approve buttons with ARIA roles

6. **Performance Targets**

   * Initial deck render: ≤150ms
   * ZKP validation: ≤100ms
   * Full load cycle (render + validation): ≤200ms

🧠 **GROK**: Prepare QA envelope for `DeckDetailView.tsx`, validating CID fetch, ZKP verification, access control branching, and mobile compliance.
📡 **Claude**: Proceed with build now. PAUSE after implementation until GROK completes QA audit.
🛑 Do not proceed to Step 3 until lock-in confirmation is issued.

👁️ **Commander Mark**, build unlocked per your directive. System status remains green.
📡 **GROK**, expect Claude’s Step 2 build soon. All protocol channels active.
📡 **Claude**, begin `DeckDetailView.tsx` build now. You are officially unpaused. 🟢
