SUBJECT: PHASE XVI.3 AUTHORIZATION ‚Äî Push Notification Ruleset Directive
Timestamp: 01:47 AM EDT | Saturday, July 19, 2025

‚∏ª

‚úÖ PHASE XVI.3 INITIATED ‚Äî CIVIC PUSH NOTIFICATION SIMULATION SYSTEM ONLINE

Commander Mark has authorized Phase XVI.3: Push Notification Ruleset, which will enable trust-based civic alerting, ZIP-linked notification logic, and legislation-driven push simulations for constituent targeting and feedback triggering.

This phase simulates a real-time push infrastructure tied to district activity, trust volatility, and live bill changes.

‚∏ª

üì¨ OBJECTIVE

Implement PushRuleEngine.ts and wire mock alert dispatch to the existing GovMapEngine.tsx interaction logic.

‚∏ª

üîß IMPLEMENTATION DIRECTIVE

Core Component:
	‚Ä¢	PushRuleEngine.ts (in client/src/agents/)

‚∏ª

üß© Core Features to Implement
	1.	PushRuleEngine.ts
	‚Ä¢	Function: evaluatePushRules(context: PushContext): PushAlert[]
	‚Ä¢	Inputs:

{
  zip: "20852",
  district: "8B",
  trustLevel: 61,
  streak: 6,
  activeBills: [ /* from LegiFeedService */ ]
}


	‚Ä¢	Outputs: Array of push alerts:

[
  { type: "trust-drop", message: "‚ö†Ô∏è Trust volatility detected in District 8B" },
  { type: "bill-watch", message: "üìú New bill ‚ÄòHB2034‚Äô needs your attention" }
]


	2.	Integration with GovMapEngine
	‚Ä¢	On district select:
	‚Ä¢	Pull session state (trust/streak) and current bills
	‚Ä¢	Pass to evaluatePushRules()
	‚Ä¢	Display push alert overlay
	‚Ä¢	Console log each alert
	3.	ARIA Live Region
	‚Ä¢	Alerts announced via aria-live="assertive"
	‚Ä¢	Example: "‚ö†Ô∏è Trust volatility detected in your district"
	4.	Push Thresholds
	‚Ä¢	Trigger ‚Äútrust-drop‚Äù if trustLevel <65
	‚Ä¢	Trigger ‚Äúbill-watch‚Äù if new bill introduced in past 48 hours
	5.	Fallback
	‚Ä¢	If no alerts: "‚úÖ No critical updates for your district" (logged and spoken)

üõë REMINDER:
	‚Ä¢	This is a simulation only ‚Äî no backend push infra or notification tokens
	‚Ä¢	All logic runs in-app, triggered via view interactions and session state

üì° Proceed with implementation. Notify JASMY Relay upon completion. GROK will initiate QA re-audit.

End Transmission ‚Äî Phase XVI.3 is now live. üü¢
