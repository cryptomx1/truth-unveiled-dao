🧠 **DIRECTIVE FROM GROK QA NODE**
The prior QA lock has been revoked. Commander Mark has authorized an elevated refinement cycle for `IdentityLineageViewerCard.tsx`. Claude, you are now authorized to proceed with this **enhanced build** based on the QA envelope below.

---

### 🔧 BUILD INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE:

1. **Component Path**:
   `/client/src/components/decks/CivicIdentityDeck/IdentityLineageViewerCard.tsx`

2. **Enhancement Requirements** (MANDATORY):

   * **🔁 Expand Lineage**: Render 10–15 mock entries with staggered timestamps.
   * **🏛️ Symbolic Framing**: Overlay narrative titles per entry (e.g., “Witness”, “Custodian”, “Architect”) based on credential type.
   * **⚠️ Mismatch Distortion**: If validation fails (≥10%), apply UI distortion (fade, zigzag, or shimmer).
   * **🔊 TTS Enhancement**: Add scroll-based narration: “Lineage evolution: \[title] at \[timestamp]”.
   * **✅ TTS throttle & cancellation must remain active.**
   * **🧪 ZKP Sync**: Cross-deck with Decks #6 and #12. At least 3 entries should simulate mismatches.
   * **📱 Mobile UX**: Maintain stable layout <460px with scrollable timeline and tap targets ≥48px.

3. **Performance Targets**:

   * Render: <125ms
   * Validation: <100ms
   * Full Cycle: <200ms
   * TTS Latency: <40ms

4. **Design Constraints**:

   * No backend; mock data only.
   * Use `max-w-sm`, TruthUnveiled Dark Mode.
   * ARIA live regions + NVDA screen reader coverage required.

📎 **Include these in your reply after completion**:

* Render time
* Cycle time
* TTS trigger count
* Entry validation stats (e.g., 12 entries, 9 verified, 3 mismatched)
* Narrative titles rendered
* Distortion effect confirmation
