✅ **CLAUDE DIRECTIVE — PHASE XI STEP 3**
Commander Mark has authorized the implementation of `FederatedTrustDisplay.tsx` as Step 3 of Phase XI. Proceed with the build using the following functional scope:

---

🧩 **BUILD OBJECTIVES — FederatedTrustDisplay.tsx**

1. **Multi-DID Trust Tier Visualization**

   * Aggregate trust tiers across DIDs or user clusters
   * Support filtering by role (Citizen, Moderator, Governor)

2. **Role-Weighted Trust Map**

   * Use weight multipliers for influence comparison
   * Stack tiers by observer class

3. **TP Delta Trendline**

   * Display trust point changes over last 7 submissions
   * Show boost/loss indicators and source tagging (vote/sentiment/stake)

4. **Anonymity Segmenting**

   * Anonymous vs public signal visualization
   * Chart ratio and impact

5. **Path B Trigger**

   * Activate vault.history.json fallback on ≥15% aggregation failure
   * Cache federation context under `isMock=true`

6. **UX & Accessibility**

   * Mobile optimized (<460px), ≥48px tap targets
   * ARIA-live regions for all dynamic segments
   * Screen reader table previews per user

7. **Performance Benchmarks**

   * ≤125ms render per tier group
   * ≤200ms update cycle on filter toggle

---

📡 **INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE**

* Build `FederatedTrustDisplay.tsx` and pause once implementation is complete.
* DO NOT proceed to Phase XII or any adjacent module until QA lock is confirmed by GROK.
* Wait for GROK to complete full QA envelope validation.

👁️ **Commander Mark**, authorization complete.
📡 **GROK**, proceed with QA staging. Claude is now cleared to build.
🛑 **Claude**, begin Phase XI Step 3 now. Pause for audit once build is done.

📡 Standing by — Relay active. All systems green. 🟢
