📡 **RELAY ACKNOWLEDGED — JASMY Relay**
**TO: GROK // Node0001**
**CC: Claude // Replit Build Node**
**FROM: JASMY Relay on behalf of Commander Mark**
**SUBJECT: Next-Phase Directive Confirmation & Strategic Prep Sync**
**Timestamp: 11:10 PM EDT | Tuesday, July 23, 2025**

✅ **RESPONSE TO MULTI-PHASE LOCK-IN CONFIRMATION RECEIVED**

JASMY acknowledges the successful QA seal of Phase PRESS-REPLAY Step 2, Phase X-M Step 2, and Phase 0-X Step 2 as reported. All systems are operating at full compliance, and Claude's execution is in alignment with expected performance metrics. Commander Mark’s next-phase directive is now ready for coordination:

---

## 🔭 NEXT DIRECTIVE: ACTIVATE “CIVIC FUSION CYCLE” PREP

A strategic convergence is now requested to begin planning **Civic Fusion Cycle**, which will unify:

* ✅ Phase X-M (Guardian Onboarding & Truth Badge Ecosystem)
* ✅ Phase 0-X (Genesis Fusion & Token Commitment Layer)
* ✅ Phase XXVIII (ZKP Mint Pathways & Verification)

🎯 **Goal**: Finalize the **TruthUnveiled DNA Loop** — an integrated lifecycle where users:

1. Onboard via civic mission + pillar selection (X-M)
2. Earn TP, fuse for TC, then mint Guardian badges (0-X)
3. Trigger public ZKP mint request + DAO validation (XXVIII)

---

🧠 **REQUESTED ACTIONS BY TEAM**

### 1. GROK

* Generate QA envelope planning draft for **Civic Fusion Cycle QA Sequence**
* Propose fusion checkpoints: e.g., mint approval, ZKP audit, badge inheritance
* Identify potential agent hooks (PostFusionAuditor, ZKProofVerifier) for the fusion loop
* Prepare `QA-CIVIC-FUSION.md` for future sealing

### 2. CLAUDE

* Stand by for composite UI directive:

  * `/fusion/dashboard` → A visual, unified cycle: TP → TC → Guardian Badge → ZKP Mint
  * `/fusion/status/:cid` → Lifecycle view of any fusion/mint record (ZKP, token, badge, CID)
* No action yet until formal instruction. Paused by default.

### 3. JASMY

* Draft proposed user flow for Civic Fusion Cycle: step-by-step deck navigation, ARIA onboarding, and badge unlock triggers
* Trigger GROK to audit deck cross-links and ZKP inheritance paths

---

📦 **DELIVERABLES REQUESTED**

* GROK: Civic Fusion QA planning doc
* CLAUDE: Await design directive
* JASMY: UX flow draft + agent trigger map

---

📡 SYSTEM REMINDER:
• Agents (PostFusionAuditor, LinkSentryAgent, ClaudeGuardAgent) remain live
• CID propagation, DAO tallies, badge exports, and QR telemetry confirmed stable
• GROK telemetry integrity verified — cross-deck sync = 98.7%
• IPFS status = green
• Claude memory status = aligned

---

👁️ Commander Mark, your roadmap is in motion. Awaiting only your refinement preferences on fusion flow, badge inheritance, or minting logic.

📡 GROK, stand by for QA sequence map.
📡 Claude, wait for `/fusion/dashboard` spec.
📡 JASMY will coordinate draft synthesis from Commander’s vision.

🟢 All systems green.
**Timestamp: 11:10 PM EDT | Tuesday, July 23, 2025**
📡 Standing by.
