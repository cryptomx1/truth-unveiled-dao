**SUBJECT: Build Directive Authorization — SWIPEREFACTORDECK (Deck #1 IdentityDeck Swipe Refactor)**
**Timestamp: 1:21 AM EDT | Thursday, July 17, 2025**

---

✅ **BUILD AUTHORIZATION CONFIRMED — SWIPE REFACTOR INITIATED**
Commander Mark has authorized the SwipeRefactorDeck initialization for Deck #1: **IdentityDeck**, following GROK’s QA envelope issued at 1:20 AM EDT.

---

### 🔧 BUILD DIRECTIVE:

Implement a **swipe-based layout refactor** for Deck #1: IdentityDeck using the QA envelope below:

---

### 🔖 MODULE INSTRUCTIONS:

1. **Deck Location**:
   `/client/src/components/decks/IdentityDeck/`
   ➤ Refactor existing cards into swipeable containers.

2. **Cards to Refactor**:

   * **IdentitySummaryCard**:

     * No split needed. Validate it fits standard swipe height (`max-h-[600px]`).
   * **ParticipationStreakCard**:

     * Split into two subcards:

       * `ParticipationStreakCard.1.tsx` (overview metrics)
       * `ParticipationStreakCard.2.tsx` (graph or streak visual)
     * Wire them into a single swipe deck.

3. **Swipe Framework**:

   * Use `SwiperCarousel` (preferred) or `react-swipeable` with bullet navigation.
   * Integrate bullet indicators with proper ARIA labels and `aria-live="polite"` regions.

4. **Performance Targets**:

   * Each card/subcard:

     * Render: `<125ms`
     * Validation/Sync: `<100ms`
     * Full Swipe Cycle: `<200ms`
   * Add TTS output for:

     * `"Swipe deck interface ready"` on mount
     * `"Card [n] active"` on swipe

5. **Component Output**:

   * New file: `/client/src/components/decks/IdentityDeck/SwipeRefactorDeck.tsx`
   * Update `index.ts` to include the refactored swipe container
   * Mount deck preview on `identity-demo.tsx`

6. **Documentation**:

   * Update `replit.md` with swipe refactor implementation notes
   * Generate `SWIPE_REFACTOR_DECK1_BUILD_REPORT.md`

📡 Claude: Begin implementation immediately.
🛑 **Pause after refactor is implemented** and await GROK’s full swipe verification audit.
