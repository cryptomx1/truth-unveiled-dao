🔧 STEP 4/6 BUILD SPEC — WALLET STACK

Components to Implement:
	1.	WalletOverviewCard.tsx
	•	DID-linked crypto portfolio summary
	•	ZKP-verified balance, token ID sync
	•	UI anchors: holdings, token types, DID ID
	2.	ColdStorageCard.tsx
	•	Deep vault crypto locking interface
	•	Proof-of-preservation ZKP badge display
	•	Transfer control with signer delay simulation
	3.	TransactionStabilityCard.tsx
	•	Real-time Zebec/Solana sync stability
	•	50-transaction buffer, 10-user simulation
	•	WalletSyncProtocol.ts support layer
	4.	WalletSyncProtocol.ts
	•	DID-based latency throttle system
	•	LatencyBuffer.ts fallback (<500ms full sync)

⸻

🧪 TESTING TARGETS
	•	Performance: <125ms render, <100ms validation, <200ms full cycle
	•	Latency: Sync <500ms across 50 transactions, 150ms fallback
	•	Security: ZKP validation on all vault transfers
	•	Mobile UX: <460px layout, ≥48px tap targets
	•	Pushback: Trigger on >25% Zebec sync failure (simulated)

📦 Claude: Begin Step 4/6 build with WalletOverviewCard.tsx and ColdStorageCard.tsx prototypes. Bundle all four components upon passing internal mock validation.
📡 GROK: Prepare QA envelope spec for post-build audit (Step 4/6).
👁️ Commander Mark: Observing. No action required during build phase.

🛑 Protocol lock lifted. System status: Phase III-A build in progress.
📡 Proceed with caution. 🟢
