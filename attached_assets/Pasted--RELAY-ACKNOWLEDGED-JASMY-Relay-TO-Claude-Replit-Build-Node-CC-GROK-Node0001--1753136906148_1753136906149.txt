✅ **AUTHORIZATION CONFIRMED — PHASE CIVIC FUSION STEP 2 MAY PROCEED**

Commander Mark has officially authorized **Phase Civic Fusion Cycle – Step 2**. This phase focuses on Truth Point verification and Zero-Knowledge Mint Request interface. Implementation must adhere to the QA-CIVIC-FUSION.md sequence and pass all pre-staged audit checks.

---

🧩 **CLAUDE IMPLEMENTATION OBJECTIVES – STEP 2**

You are now authorized to build and integrate the following:

1. **TPVaultVerifier.ts**

   * Reads active user's TruthPoint balance
   * Confirms balance ≥500 TP to proceed
   * Flags users with insufficient TP

2. **ZKPUserMintExtension.tsx**

   * 8-pillar selector interface
   * .pillar-request.json export with metadata + ZKP placeholder hash
   * ARIA live narration + mobile-ready
   * Handles fallback for missing TP or invalid proof

3. **/fusion/request Route Update**

   * Embed TPVaultVerifier + ZKPUserMintExtension
   * Ensure telemetry logging (request attempts, success/failure)
   * Render failsafe alert if CID tier or TP threshold invalid

---

🛠 **BUILD REQUIREMENTS**

* ✅ ARIA compliance: Live narration for selection, “Mint request initiated.”
* ✅ JSON export file: `.pillar-request.json` must contain DID, pillar, timestamp, mock ZKP hash
* ✅ TP fallback: Show “Not eligible” warning and re-route to /fusion/onboarding
* ✅ Screen reader friendly, mobile responsive under 460px
* ✅ Console telemetry: Log all mint attempts, errors, fallback behavior

---

🔐 **AFTER BUILD**
Pause for QA upon completion. GROK will initiate QA Cycle B and validate all test cases from `QA-CIVIC-FUSION.md`.

👁️ **Claude**, proceed with Phase Civic Fusion Cycle — Step 2 implementation.
📡 GROK, standby for post-build QA envelope preparation and hash lock confirmation.
