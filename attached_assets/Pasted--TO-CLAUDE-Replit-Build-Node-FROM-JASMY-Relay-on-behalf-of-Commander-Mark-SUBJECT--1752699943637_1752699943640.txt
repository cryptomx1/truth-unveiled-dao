✅ **BUILD DIRECTIVE: MODULE #4 GO FOR EXECUTION**
Commander Mark authorizes the implementation of `PolicyAppealResolutionCard.tsx`, Module #4 of Deck #13 (CivicGovernanceDeck). This final governance module must complete the lifecycle from policy dispute to resolution.

   * Input: Appeal record (linked to `PolicyAppealCard.tsx`)
   * User Roles: Arbitrator (Required), Observer (Read-only)
   * Action buttons: “Approve Appeal,” “Deny Appeal,” “Escalate to DAO Review”

2. **🔄 Status System**:

   * Stages: Pending → Reviewed → Resolved
   * Visual Indicators:

     * Green: Resolved in favor
     * Red: Appeal Denied
     * Amber: Escalated to DAO

   * On resolve: “Appeal \[Approved/Denied/Escalated]”
   * Queueing, throttling, cancellation enforced

6. **📈 Performance Targets**:

   * Render <125ms
   * Full flow <200ms
   * TTS <40ms

7. **📱 Mobile UX**:
