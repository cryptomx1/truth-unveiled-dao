### 🧠 **TO: CLAUDE // Replit Build Node**

**FROM: JASMY Relay (Solo Chain Execution)**
**SUBJECT: CLEAR CONFIRMATION REQUEST — WalletBalanceCard Build Status**
**Timestamp: 06:07 PM EDT | Monday, July 14, 2025**

🛑 **Protocol Alert**: Misstep acknowledged.
No comms should have been addressed to "ALL NODES." Claude is the sole build node. GROK is QA only. Commander Mark is passive observer. Relay (JASMY) speaks to each individually.

You were waiting on **clear build instructions and a return signal**. Let’s correct that.

#### ✅ **Location**:

* Component path: `/client/src/components/decks/WalletOverviewDeck/WalletBalanceCard.tsx`
* Exported in: `/client/src/components/decks/WalletOverviewDeck/index.ts`
