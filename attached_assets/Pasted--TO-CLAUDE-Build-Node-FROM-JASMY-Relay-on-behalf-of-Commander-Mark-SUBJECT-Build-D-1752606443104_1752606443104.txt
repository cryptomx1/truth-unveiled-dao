🧠 **TO: CLAUDE // Build Node**
**FROM: JASMY Relay on behalf of Commander Mark**
**SUBJECT: Build Directive — EncryptedMessageCard.tsx (Deck #5 Module #3)**
**Timestamp: 7:13 PM EDT | Monday, July 15, 2025**

---

✅ **BUILD AUTHORIZED**
Proceed with the implementation of `EncryptedMessageCard.tsx` for **Deck #5: PrivacyDeck**.

---

### 📐 DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS

**Component Name**: `EncryptedMessageCard.tsx`
**Deck**: PrivacyDeck (Deck #5)
**Module**: #3
**Theme**: TruthUnveiled Dark Mode (`bg-slate-900`, `text-slate-100`)
**Max Width**: `max-w-sm` (460px)

---

### 🎯 FUNCTIONAL OBJECTIVE

Build a secure, interactive encrypted messaging interface. It must simulate:

* Real-time encrypted message log (mocked)
* Obfuscated DID sender IDs (e.g., `user_459x` → `anon_e21k`)
* Secure input field for composing new encrypted messages
* TTS confirmation of new message received
* Toggleable ZKP lock icon placeholder: “Fully encrypted messaging available in Deck #6”

### 📋 BUILD REQUIREMENTS (from QA Envelope)

| Category               | Spec                                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **💬 Message Bubbles** | Alternating left/right, rounded, with timestamp and masked DID                            |
| **🔐 Encryption UX**   | Input bar for new message, preview message as “Encrypted: \*\*\*\*\*\*”, DID obfuscation  |
| **🧠 TTS**             | "Secure message channel active." on mount + "New encrypted message received." per update  |
| **♿ ARIA**             | Region labeling, live update for new messages (`aria-live="polite"`), tab order validated |
| **🔒 ZKP Placeholder** | Lock icon + tooltip “Fully encrypted messaging available in Deck #6” — no active controls |
| **⏱️ Performance**     | Render <125ms, input/send <50ms, total flow <200ms                                        |
| **📱 Mobile UX**       | Tap targets ≥48px, layout stability under 460px                                           |

---

### 🔄 INTERACTIONS TO INCLUDE

* TTS on mount + TTS trigger when new mock message is "received"
* Manual input field for composing messages (simulate encryption)
* Masked DID display (mocked with `anon_xxxxx`)
* Lock badge inactive with tooltip (Deck #6 pointer)

---

🛑 **NOTE**: No live encryption or backend logic. All data is mocked.
