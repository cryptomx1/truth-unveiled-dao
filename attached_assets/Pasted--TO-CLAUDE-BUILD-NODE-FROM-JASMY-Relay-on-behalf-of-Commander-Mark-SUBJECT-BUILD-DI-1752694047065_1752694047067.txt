üß† **TO: CLAUDE (BUILD NODE)**
**FROM: JASMY Relay on behalf of Commander Mark**
**SUBJECT: BUILD DIRECTIVE ‚Äî DIDClaimCard.tsx (Deck #12 CivicIdentityDeck, Module #1)**
**Timestamp: 1:28 PM EDT | Wednesday, July 16, 2025**

---

‚úÖ **BUILD AUTHORIZATION GRANTED**
Claude, you are now authorized to implement **`DIDClaimCard.tsx`** as Module #1 of **Deck #12: CivicIdentityDeck**, following GROK‚Äôs QA envelope (timestamp: 1:27 PM EDT). Proceed with the build at:

üìÇ **Path**: `/client/src/components/decks/CivicIdentityDeck/DIDClaimCard.tsx`

---

### üéØ CORE FUNCTIONALITY TO IMPLEMENT

1. **DID Format Field**

   * Input field with mock DID validation (`did:civic:abc123...`)
   * Regex validation logic and mock ZKP proof injection
   * Status feedback with colored indicators (green = valid, red = invalid)

2. **Key Rotation Simulation**

   * ‚ÄúRotate Key‚Äù button triggering mock new DID
   * Simulated 2-second delay with animation/transition

3. **Credential Issuance Badge**

   * Visual indicator (e.g., pulsing ring or badge) once a valid DID is confirmed

4. **Biometric ZKP Placeholder**

   * Placeholder zone indicating ‚ÄúBiometric ZKP Required‚Äù (non-functional mock)
   * Display 3 visual states: inactive / pending / verified (faded text only)

5. **TTS Announcements**

   * On mount: `"DID claim interface ready"`
   * On issuance: `"Credential issued"`
   * Use Web Speech API with latency target <40ms

6. **Accessibility**

   * `aria-live="polite"` for live updates
   * Full tab navigation and role="region" compliance

7. **Visuals (Dark Mode)**

   * Use: `bg-slate-900`, `text-slate-100`, `ring-green-500`, `ring-red-500`, `ring-amber-400`
   * Icons: `i-fa-id-card` for claim

8. **Performance Targets**

   * Render <125ms
   * Validation <100ms
   * Full cycle <200ms
   * No layout shifts; mobile UX stable under 460px

---

üìé **REMINDERS**:

* Use mock data only (no backend hooks)
* Avoid overlapping audio: ensure TTS cancel behavior is respected
* Match component styling to previously sealed Decks #6‚Äì#11 for visual continuity
* Do not add animation to entire card‚Äîlimit it to badge/indicator only

---

üß† Claude, pause after implementation. JASMY will inspect before passing to GROK for QA validation. Await further instruction after build completion. üü¢

üëÅÔ∏è Commander Mark is observing.
JASMY is active.
GROK is standing by.
Claude: ‚úÖ Authorized for single-module build.
