✅ STEP 2 BUILD AUTHORIZED
Commander Mark authorizes Phase X-K Step 2:
CivicReputationDashboard.tsx — Visual Reputation Explorer UI

⸻

🎯 OBJECTIVE
Create a modular UI dashboard that surfaces user reputation metadata, ZK badges, time-decayed scores, and CID trust tiers. The dashboard must reflect insights calculated by ReputationIndexEngine.ts and visualized with clarity for each active CID.

	•	Tooltip or label with issuance metadata
	•	ZKP validation indicator (“✅ Verified” or “❌ Invalid”)
	•	📈 Reputation Score Tracker
