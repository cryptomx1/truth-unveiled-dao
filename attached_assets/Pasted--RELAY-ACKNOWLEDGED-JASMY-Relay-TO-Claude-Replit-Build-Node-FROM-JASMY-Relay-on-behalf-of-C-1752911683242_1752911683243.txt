SUBJECT: PHASE XXII AUTHORIZATION — DAO Integration & zk-Vote Contract Simulation Initialization
Timestamp: 03:53 AM EDT | Saturday, July 19, 2025

⸻

✅ PHASE XXII INITIATED — DAO VOTE ENGINE + ZK PROOF CONTRACT SIMULATION ONLINE

Commander Mark has authorized Phase XXII, activating the system’s first DAO governance logic layer, including a simulated smart contract for zk-vote proof submission and result aggregation.

This phase introduces zero-knowledge-protected onchain voting, where user feedback is cast, verified, and tallied with privacy-preserving credentials and tier-weighting logic.

⸻

🗳️ OBJECTIVE

Deploy a zk-vote-enabled contract simulation layer and integrate .zkp-chain.json proofs into DAO-compatible vote registration and result dashboards.

⸻

🔧 IMPLEMENTATION DIRECTIVE

Core Modules:
	•	DAOVoteEngine.ts (contract simulation)
	•	ZKPProofRegistrar.ts (proof submission agent)
	•	VoteResultsPanel.tsx (vote tally UI + tier weighting)
	•	Updates to FeedbackExportPanel.tsx for submission and results redirection

Location:
	•	client/src/dao/, client/src/components/dao/

⸻

🧩 Phase XXII Step 1 — Functional Targets
	1.	DAOVoteEngine.ts
	•	Accepts ZKP proof bundles
	•	Verifies:
	•	External nullifier uniqueness
	•	Nullifier non-repeat
	•	Tier weighting (Citizen: 1x, Moderator: 2x, Governor: 3x)
	•	Logs: "🗳️ DAO Vote Registered — Tier: [tier] | Weight: [x]"
	2.	ZKPProofRegistrar.ts
	•	Submits .zkp-chain.json
	•	Response: { status: success, voteId, blockSimulatedAt, weight }
	•	Logs: "📨 Proof Submitted to DAO — Vote ID: [voteId]"
	3.	VoteResultsPanel.tsx
	•	UI showing:
	•	Yes/No/Abstain vote counts
	•	Weighted influence chart
	•	Recent activity stream
	•	ARIA live narration: "🗳️ Vote tally updated: 62 Support, 17 Oppose, 21 Abstain"
	4.	FeedbackExportPanel.tsx
	•	Adds “Submit to DAO” button
	•	Links to VoteResultsPanel.tsx after successful registration

| Performance | Vote submission + tally ≤2s
| ARIA | Live narration of tally updates + vote confirmation

🛑 REMINDER:
	•	This is a simulated zk-vote DAO — smart contract logic mimicked in memory
	•	Vote weighting and nullifier enforcement required per user tier

📡 Proceed with implementation. Notify JASMY Relay upon completion. GROK will initiate QA re-audit.

End Transmission — Phase XXII Step 1 is now live. 🟢
