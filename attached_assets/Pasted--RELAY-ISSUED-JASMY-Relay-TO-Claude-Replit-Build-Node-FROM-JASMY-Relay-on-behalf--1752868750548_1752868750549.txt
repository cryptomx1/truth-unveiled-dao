**FROM: JASMY Relay on behalf of Commander Mark**
**SUBJECT: UI Remediation Directive — Deck Layout Refactor Deployment**

✅ **CLAUDE DIRECTIVE — DECK LAYOUT REFACTOR INITIATION**

Commander Mark has authorized an immediate deck layout cleanup in response to the confirmed QA scan from GROK. Your objective is to **implement layout standardization and rendering stabilization across the 20+ modular decks** and all phase components as outlined below.

---

📌 **MANDATORY OBJECTIVES — IMPLEMENT IN SINGLE PASS**

### 1. **Card Sizing Normalization**

* Apply consistent card boundaries:
  `min-w-[300px] max-w-[460px] h-auto`
* Add `flex-1` to deck wrappers to allow proportional scaling

### 2. **Flickering Fixes**

* Memoize all dynamic child components using `React.memo`
* Add `key` props to `.map()` iterations
* Apply `useCallback` for event handlers triggering renders

### 3. **Overlay & Z-Index Hygiene**

* Standardize overlay components with `z-[50]`
* Modals: `z-[100]` minimum
* Use `React Portal` where overlays are conflicting with stacked elements

### 4. **Mobile Viewport Consistency**

* All deck components must respect Tailwind breakpoint: `@media (max-width: 460px)`
* Stack cards vertically and center-align
* Add `overflow-y-auto` to outer deck wrappers to prevent scroll lock
* Ensure tap targets are `≥48px`

### 5. **Lifecycle Cleanup (Memory Leak Prevention)**

* All `useEffect` hooks that use timers, subscriptions, or listeners must include:
  `return () => { ...cleanup logic... }`
* Audit and fix:

  * `MultiStakeCred.tsx`
  * `FederatedTrustDisplay.tsx`
  * `TrustAuditOverlay.tsx`
  * `DeckModulePreview.tsx`

---

🧠 **CONTEXT FILES TO TARGET**

* `/client/src/components/decks/**/*.tsx`
* `/client/src/components/phase/**/*.tsx`
* `identity-demo.tsx` (deck wrapper cleanup)
* Overlay components (`Modal.tsx`, `OverlayCard.tsx`, etc.)

---

📦 **OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS**

* Apply changes without introducing new logic or regressions
* Ensure **no console warnings**, layout overflows, or scroll jitter
* After remediation, pause and await GROK QA re-audit
* Do **not** proceed to Phase XII until JASMY gives clearance

---

🔐 **CLAUDE STATUS FLAG**: `DECK_REFACTOR_CLEANUP`
🛑 All future builds are paused until deck integrity is restored and GROK revalidates post-refactor QA.

👁️ Claude, initiate deck-wide layout refactor now and pause after full pass. Notify JASMY upon completion.
📡 Standing by for implementation result. All systems green. 🟢
