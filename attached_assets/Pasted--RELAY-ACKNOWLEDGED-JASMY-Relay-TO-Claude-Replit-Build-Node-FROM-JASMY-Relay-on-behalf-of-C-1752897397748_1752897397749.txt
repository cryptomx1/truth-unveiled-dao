FROM: JASMY Relay on behalf of Commander Mark
SUBJECT: PHASE XI-D AUTHORIZATION ‚Äî Translation System Bootstrap Directive
Timestamp: 11:55 PM EDT | Friday, July 18, 2025

‚∏ª

‚úÖ PHASE XI-D INITIATED ‚Äî MULTILINGUAL TRANSLATION SYSTEM ONLINE

Commander Mark has authorized Phase XI-D: Translation System Bootstrap ‚Äî the critical infrastructure to enable dynamic, full-system localization across all modules. This phase will resolve hardcoded English content by centralizing all UI strings into language-specific files and connecting them via a t(key) utility function.

‚∏ª

üåê OBJECTIVE

Implement a centralized multilingual translation system with .json dictionaries and integrate it across major civic modules using the t('key') utility.

‚∏ª

üîß IMPLEMENTATION DIRECTIVE

New Files to Create:
	‚Ä¢	translation/en.json
	‚Ä¢	translation/es.json
	‚Ä¢	translation/fr.json
	‚Ä¢	useTranslation.ts (with t(key) and fallback logic)

‚∏ª

üß© Core Features to Implement:
	1.	Translation Dictionary Structure
	‚Ä¢	Example (en.json):

{
  "mission.selectPrompt": "What is your mission today?",
  "deck.feedback.title": "Feedback Dashboard",
  "tier.citizen": "Citizen",
  "streak.days": "{{count}} Days Streak"
}


	2.	useTranslation() Hook
	‚Ä¢	Pulls current lang from LangContext
	‚Ä¢	Returns:
	‚Ä¢	t(key: string, params?: Record<string, string | number>)
	‚Ä¢	Includes fallback logic if key or lang missing
	‚Ä¢	Logs fallback event: "‚ö†Ô∏è Missing translation: [key] for [lang]"
	3.	Module Refactors
	‚Ä¢	Update at least 2 key modules to use t():
	‚Ä¢	CivicMissionOnboardingCard.tsx
	‚Ä¢	UnifiedNavBarExtension.tsx
	‚Ä¢	Replace all visible strings with translation keys
	4.	Parameter Interpolation
	‚Ä¢	Support placeholders (e.g., "{{count}}") using params in t()
	‚Ä¢	Example:

t('streak.days', { count: 6 }) // ‚Üí ‚Äú6 Days Streak‚Äù


	5.	Fallback Logging
	‚Ä¢	Console output when missing key or unsupported lang encountered

Console Logs	

	‚Ä¢	"üåê Translation system initialized for lang: ES"
	‚Ä¢	"‚ö†Ô∏è Missing translation: deck.audit.title for fr" |
| Performance | t() resolve ‚â§10ms, UI updates <200ms |
| UI | Must reflect selected lang toggle immediately on string level |
| ARIA | Labels, tooltips, buttons localized where possible |

‚∏ª

üõë REMINDER:
	‚Ä¢	Only refactor 2‚Äì3 modules in this step for proof-of-concept
	‚Ä¢	ZKP content, proposal logs, and heatmaps will be refactored in later i18n pass
	‚Ä¢	This bootstrap lays the groundwork for Phase XII (Multilingual Governance Core)

üì° Proceed with implementation. Notify JASMY Relay upon completion. GROK will initiate QA re-audit.

End Transmission ‚Äî Phase XI-D is now active. üü¢
