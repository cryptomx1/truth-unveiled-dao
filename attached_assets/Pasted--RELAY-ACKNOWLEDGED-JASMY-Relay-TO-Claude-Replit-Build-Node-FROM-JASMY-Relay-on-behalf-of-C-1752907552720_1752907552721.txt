SUBJECT: PHASE XVIII AUTHORIZATION — ZIP-Based Civic Feedback Engine Initialization

⸻

✅ PHASE XVIII INITIATED — CONSTITUENT FEEDBACK CHANNELS ONLINE

Commander Mark has authorized Phase XVIII, activating the ZIP-Based Civic Feedback Engine — the platform’s first direct democracy interface for live legislation. Citizens will now be able to register support, dissent, or abstain on current bills by ZIP code, with ZKP-compatible feedback tagging, streak tracking, and mission integration.

⸻

💬 OBJECTIVE

Deploy FeedbackZoneEngine.tsx and route bill-level feedback to the active ZIP/district context from GovMapEngine.tsx + LegiFeedService.ts.

⸻

🔧 IMPLEMENTATION DIRECTIVE

Primary Module:
	•	FeedbackZoneEngine.tsx
	•	Location: client/src/components/feedback/

⸻

🧩 Phase XVIII Step 1: Feature Targets
	1.	ZIP-Tied Feedback Card
	•	FeedbackContext input:

{
  zip: "20852",
  district: "8B",
  billId: "HR2034",
  title: "Civic Data Privacy Act",
  sponsor: "Rep. Lin",
  status: "Introduced"
}


	•	Feedback options:
	•	👍 Support
	•	👎 Oppose
	•	🤷 Abstain
	•	Each triggers telemetry + ZKP placeholder stamp

	2.	ZKP Tag Simulation
	•	On feedback:
	•	Log: "🔐 Feedback recorded — Bill: HR2034, Vote: Support, Tier: Citizen"
	3.	Integration with GovMap
	•	After district selection + bill display:
	•	Render FeedbackZoneEngine beneath bill metadata
	•	All votes recorded to in-memory feedback stream (mock)
	4.	Feedback Streak + Trust Pulse
	•	Show:
	•	“You’ve submitted 3/5 votes this month”
	•	“Current Trust Index: 81%”
	5.	ARIA & Mobile
	•	Feedback options must be:
	•	role=button, aria-label, tabIndex=0
	•	Screen reader compatible
	•	Layout responsive under 460px

🛑 REMINDER:
	•	No persistence yet — all feedback simulated in local memory
	•	ZKP tags are console only for this step — actual chain signing in future Phase XIX

📡 Proceed with implementation. Notify JASMY Relay upon completion. GROK will initiate Phase XVIII QA re-audit.

End Transmission — Phase XVIII is now live. 🟢
