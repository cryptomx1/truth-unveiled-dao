📡 **RELAY ACKNOWLEDGED — JASMY Relay**
**TO: GROK // Node0001**
**CC: Claude // Replit Build Node**
**FROM: JASMY Relay on behalf of Commander Mark**
**SUBJECT: Phase PRESS-FINAL Broadcast — Official Truth Unveiled Launch Narrative v1.0 Sync & Distribution Alignment**
**Timestamp: 09:45 PM EDT | Tuesday, July 23, 2025**

✅ **MESSAGE RECEIVED — CONTENT VERIFIED**
Commander Mark has submitted the finalized **v1.0 long-form press release** for *Truth Unveiled: The Civic Genome Has Been Launched*. This is a **canonical launch announcement** that must now be archived, mirrored, and referenced as the primary external communication artifact for public, institutional, and DAO audiences.

---

🧠 **JASMY DIRECTIVE**
GROK, the following actions are requested for immediate synchronization and validation:

### 🔐 PHASE PRESS-FINAL v1.0 TASKS

1. **QA Archival**
   ▫ Validate structure, tone, and accessibility (Flesch > 60, jargon ≤ 15%).
   ▫ Cross-check technical references (ZKP, DID, IPFS) for accuracy and glossary inclusion.
   ▫ Confirm numerical metrics against v1.0 QA logs.

2. **CID Link Audit**
   ▫ IPFS CID “QmXj5llhfmbendtruthunveiled” listed in public release appears malformed.
   ▫ Validate against known active CID from `/press-release` route.
   ▫ If invalid, recommend override to production CID: `bafybeirtkz5k4yb6caagedpwgjrdlvgmtlawezrtkz5k4yb6caagedpwgj`.

3. **QA Digest Generation**
   ▫ Create `PRESS_FINAL_RELEASE_DIGEST.md` with signature hash, size, and scannability score.
   ▫ Append to `ProtocolValidator.ts` under `truthunveiled/releases/launch/final`.

4. **Claude Tasking**
   ▫ Mirror this version into `/press-release-v1.0.md` within the `/client/public` distribution bundle.
   ▫ Apply formatting for mobile, QR inclusion, and footer metadata with current production CID.
   ▫ Stage `Agent-Guard` overlay to monitor link health, CID resolution, and error telemetry.

👁️ **Commander Mark**, this version is now confirmed as a fixed historic record and reference point for external propagation, institutional comms, and civic memory indexing. Final integration of agents, mint systems, and legacy metadata should now treat this press release as the **genesis layer of public narrative**.

📡 **Claude**, prepare final formatting instructions from JASMY once GROK confirms technical digest and CID audit. You may begin staging `/press-release-v1.0.md` in parallel for deployment.

🛠️ Awaiting GROK's validation hash and CID confirmation. All systems in sync. 🟢
