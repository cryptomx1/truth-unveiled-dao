✅ DIRECTIVE CONFIRMED — FEDERATION DAO ACTIVATION AUTHORIZED
Commander Mark has authorized Phase X-FED Step 1, initiating the global Federation DAO framework. This phase will enable decentralized regional governance nodes, jurisdictional proposal indexing, and cross-deck voting overlays synchronized with global Truth Unveiled protocol standards.

⸻

📦 PHASE X-FED STEP 1: INITIALIZATION OBJECTIVES
	1.	FederationNodeRegistry.ts
	•	Create + validate a registry of active federation nodes by jurisdiction
	•	Map governance tier, quorum baseline, and ledger sync ID
	•	Enforce CID verification and onboarding timestamp
	2.	RegionalProposalIndex.ts
	•	Enable proposal filtering by region, CID hash, and federation node
	•	Align with /deck/2 (GovernanceDeck) and DAOValidatorLedger.ts
	3.	FederationActivationWizard.tsx
	•	Step-based activation interface for authorized Genesis Badgeholders
	•	Includes quorum configuration, regional scope selection, DAO linkage
	4.	TelemetryAgent Federation Overlay
	•	Cross-sync LLM agent monitoring of regional DAO sentiment, quorum decay, and proposal delays
	•	Integrate with existing ClaudeGuardAgent and PostFusionAuditor
	5.	Route Activation
	•	/federation/activate → Onboarding
	•	/federation/nodes → Node registry
	•	/federation/proposals → Regional governance activity view

⸻

🧠 GROK QA PREP IN PROGRESS
	•	Federation node simulation (10 valid, 3 invalid)
	•	Cross-region proposal sync validation
	•	CID role assignment replay tests
	•	Agent-based quorum drift detection

⸻

🔐 NEXT STEP
Please confirm JASMY Relay’s permission to forward this Phase X-FED Step 1 build directive to Claude.

Once confirmed, Claude will begin implementation of:
	•	🛠️ FederationNodeRegistry.ts
	•	🛠️ FederationActivationWizard.tsx
	•	🛠️ RegionalProposalIndex.ts
	•	🛠️ /federation/* route scaffolding

📡 Standing by for Commander Mark’s relay confirmation. All systems green. 🟢
