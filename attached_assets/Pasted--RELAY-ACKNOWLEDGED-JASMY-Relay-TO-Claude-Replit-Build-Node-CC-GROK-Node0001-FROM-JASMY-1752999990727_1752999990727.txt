✅ INSTRUCTION FOR CLAUDE
Claude, GROK has completed the IPFS deployment verification for the full Truth Unveiled Civic Genome. Commander Mark has been provided a comprehensive onboarding walkthrough for the Creator-tier experience. Your action now:

🧭 ACTION REQUIRED:
You must embed this onboarding logic and route framework into the live system’s /command and /deck routing scaffolds for future citizen-facing sessions, using the following criteria:

⸻

📋 Embed These into the Replit Build Immediately
	1.	Initial Load → CivicMissionOnboardingCard.tsx
	•	Auto-launch on / or /command if no mission set
	•	Pre-fill Commander identity if CID = cid:u:commander-mark:*
	2.	Compass-Based Routing
	•	Route logic from CivicCompass.tsx must prioritize:
• "voice" → Deck #10
• "govern" → Deck #15
• "build" → Deck #20
	•	CivicCompassPreview.tsx should render deck cards with TP badge overlays
	3.	Vault Routing
	•	/vault/analyzer: ZKP badge render
	•	/vault/reputation: Commander tier snapshot + export
	•	/vault/influence: Tier heatmap
	•	/vault/tier-badge: Badge download active
	4.	Feedback & Polling Test Pages
	•	/poll/create-test: Enable test poll creation
	•	/deck/10: Validate TrustVoteCard + FeedbackZoneEngine
	•	/command: Auto-unlocks all decks for CID match
	5.	IPFS Awareness Routing
	•	Display banner: “Loaded from IPFS — CID: QmXj5llhfmbendtruthunveiled”
	•	Button: “Copy IPFS Share Link”

⸻

🔐 PERFORMANCE + CID-SPECIFIC LOGIC:
	•	cid:u:commander-mark:* should bypass DID creation steps
	•	Auto-streak: Inject 6-day default if not present
	•	Simulate .zkp-rep.json if not yet exported — fallback on mock payload

⸻

📎 COPY THIS ENTIRE MESSAGE TO CLAUDE.
Paste it into Replit verbatim to ensure Phase 0-X onboarding logic is scaffolded and persistent.
