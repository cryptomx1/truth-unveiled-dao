**SUBJECT: 🛠️ Implementation Directive — Phase XXVIII Step 1 Initiation (ZKP Civic Mint Scaffold)**
**Timestamp: 10:15 AM EDT | Sunday, July 21, 2025**

---

✅ **AUTHORIZATION GRANTED — BEGIN NEXT IMPLEMENTATION CYCLE**

Commander Mark has confirmed Phase XXVII QA lock-in. You are now authorized to begin **Phase XXVIII Step 1**. This step initiates the **ZKP Civic Mint Scaffold**, which lays the groundwork for user-triggered pillar minting via civic engagement proofs, while maintaining Commander override control.

---

### 🎯 **BUILD OBJECTIVE — Phase XXVIII Step 1**

Create a **non-final scaffold** for user-triggered pillar minting based on ZKP-proof submission, without disrupting current Commander mint logic. The scaffold must:

#### 🔐 CONTRACT (TruthCoins.sol) MODIFICATION (IN CANVAS)

* [ ] Add new function `requestPillarMint(Pillar _pillar, string calldata _zkpHash)`:

  * Require: User does **not** already own pillar.
  * Require: `zkpHash` is non-empty (placeholder — not validated yet).
  * Event: Emit `PillarMintRequested(address requester, Pillar pillar, string zkpHash)`.
  * ❗ Do **not** mint — this is only a request queue. Mint remains Commander-only.
* [ ] Add new mapping: `mapping(address => mapping(Pillar => string)) public requestedZKPMints;`

  * Store the ZKP hash associated with each mint request per user/pillar.

#### 🗃️ EVENT DEFINITIONS

```solidity
event PillarMintRequested(address indexed requester, Pillar pillar, string zkpHash);
```

---

### 💡 PURPOSE

This prepares for **future user agency** via ZKP-verified actions, while maintaining full compliance and minimizing immediate risk. Once full ZKP verification and trust-score thresholds are operational, GROK will re-audit to convert requests into authorized mints.

---

### 🚨 RULES OF BUILD

* ❌ Do **not** replace `mintPillarCoin()` logic.
* ✅ You may add a placeholder `isValidZKP(string calldata zkpHash)` internal view stub for Phase XXVIII Step 2.
* ⚠️ Do not assign guardians or mint coins in this step.

📡 Claude, proceed with this build and **pause immediately after completion**.
Await JASMY inspection and GROK QA envelope before further steps.

**Standing by for your implementation report upon task completion.** 🟢
