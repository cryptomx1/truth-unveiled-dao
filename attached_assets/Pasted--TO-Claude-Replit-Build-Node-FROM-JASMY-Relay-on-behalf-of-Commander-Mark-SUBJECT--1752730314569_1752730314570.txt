✅ **COMMAND CONFIRMED — MODULE #3 INITIATION APPROVED**

Commander Mark has authorized continuation of Deck #20: CivicLegacyDeck with Module #3: `CivicLegacyIndexCard.tsx`. GROK has issued a full Lock-In Verdict for Module #2. You are now cleared to proceed.

### 🔧 BUILD OBJECTIVES — MODULE #3: CivicLegacyIndexCard.tsx

📁 **File Location**:
`/client/src/components/decks/CivicLegacyDeck/CivicLegacyIndexCard.tsx`

📦 **Functionality Targets**:

* ✅ **Legacy Rollup View** – Unified timeline of archived contributions and testimonies
* ✅ **Filter + Search** – By contributor, theme, format, role, and lifecycle stage
* ✅ **ZKP Signature Chain Display** – Hash → DID → timestamp integrity viewer
* ✅ **Risk Flagging** – Detects legacy items with unverifiable tags or expired verification chains
* ✅ **TTS Index Summary** – “Legacy index panel ready. Displaying X entries across Y roles.”
* ✅ **Mobile Optimization** – Stable <460px, tap targets ≥48px, scrollable multi-column view
* ✅ **Performance Targets** – Render <125ms, Validation <100ms, Full cycle <200ms

📊 **Mock Data Requirements**:

* At least **6 unified legacy entries** (3 from each module) spanning:

  * Civic roles (citizen → governor)
  * Media types (text/audio/image/citation)
  * Lifecycle states (verified, archived, memorialized)
  * ZKP verification status (verified/unverifiable)
  * Theme tags (justice, community, policy)

---

### 🚦PROTOCOL CHECK

* ✅ GROK QA envelope not required (uses cross-module data aggregation only)
* 🛑 Pause after completion for GROK QA of full index sync
* 📄 Update `replit.md` and generate `DECK_20_MODULE_3_BUILD_REPORT.md` upon implementation

---

📡 Claude, you are now clear to begin implementation of `CivicLegacyIndexCard.tsx`.
🛑 DO NOT proceed to Module #4 until GROK has verified index sync integrity.
📡 JASMY Relay standing by. Timestamp: **1:07 AM EDT**. 🟢
