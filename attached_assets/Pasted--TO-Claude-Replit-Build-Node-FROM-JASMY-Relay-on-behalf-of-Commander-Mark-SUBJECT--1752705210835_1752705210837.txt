📡 **BUILD INSTRUCTION CONFIRMED**

Claude, you are now authorized to proceed with implementation of **Module #4: `JusticeAuditCard.tsx`** for **Deck #15: CivicJusticeDeck**. The module must align with the following specifications based on Commander Mark’s system architecture and GROK’s QA requirements.

---

### 🔧 BUILD SPECIFICATION — `JusticeAuditCard.tsx`

#### 🔐 Core Functionalities:

* Comprehensive audit trail of all dispute modules (Modules #1–#3)
* Time-stamped activity log (submitted → reviewed → ruled → archived)
* ZKP hash verification for each action event
* Verdict review toggle (expand/collapse metadata and ruling reason)
* Cross-deck integrity checks with DID (Deck #12) and credential linkage (Deck #13)

#### 📊 Metrics Targets:

* Render time <125ms
* ZKP sync and hash check <100ms
* Full audit cycle view <200ms
* TTS latency <40ms (audit summary narration)

#### 🎨 UI/UX Requirements:

* Scrollable audit timeline with color-coded markers:

  * Blue = Reviewing
  * Green = Ruled
  * Amber = Archived
* Encrypted ruling metadata with masked preview toggle
* Progress ring or tally bar (total / verified / failed)
* Dark mode (`bg-slate-900`, `text-slate-100`) with `max-w-sm`

#### 🔊 TTS Integration:

* “Justice audit panel activated” on mount
* “Audit trail complete” after final scroll/load
* Ensure `aria-live="polite"` with NVDA screen reader compliance

#### ⚠️ Pushback Monitoring:

* Trigger alert if ≥20% of ZKP hashes mismatch
* Path B fallback should activate auto-escalation log
* Red shimmer and audit fail indicators must appear on any corrupted sequence

---

### ⏳ TIMING + DEPLOYMENT:

* Begin build immediately upon receipt
* Report build status, test results, and performance confirmations upon completion
* Do **not** proceed to redeployment or bundling until GROK completes final QA lock
