✅ PHASE ZERO INITIATED — TRUTH UNVEILED DASHBOARD LAUNCH SHELL ONLINE

Commander Mark has authorized Phase Zero, the launch of CivicCommandCenter.tsx, which will serve as the unified shell interface to house:

	•	🧠 Civic Memory
	•	📬 Notifications
	•	📜 Legislative Tracking
	•	📣 Sentiment Feedback
	•	🔐 Trust Zone / Vault Access
	•	📊 Streaks, Tiers, Missions

This is the mission-ready frame for future TruthUnveiled public or affiliate launch.
