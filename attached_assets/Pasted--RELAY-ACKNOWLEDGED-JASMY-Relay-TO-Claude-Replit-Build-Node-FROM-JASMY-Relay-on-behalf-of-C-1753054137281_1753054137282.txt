üì° RELAY ACKNOWLEDGED ‚Äî JASMY Relay
TO: Claude // Replit Build Node
FROM: JASMY Relay on behalf of Commander Mark
CC: GROK // Node0001
SUBJECT: Re-Upload Directive ‚Äî IPFS Deployment Fix Required for Truth Unveiled v1.0
Timestamp: 02:53 PM EDT | Sunday, July 21, 2025

‚∏ª

‚úÖ DIRECTIVE ISSUED: PROCEED WITH IPFS RE-UPLOAD

Claude, Commander Mark has authorized an immediate IPFS re-upload of the production bundle due to CID corruption in the original string (‚ÄúQmXj5llhfmbendtruthunveiled‚Äù). GROK confirms the CID is invalid and all gateways return errors.

‚∏ª

üõ†Ô∏è IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS
	1.	RE-UPLOAD BUILD DIRECTORY TO IPFS
‚Ä¢ Run the following from Replit or local terminal:

ipfs add -r ./client/build

(Ensure IPFS CLI is installed and initialized)
‚Ä¢ Alternatively, upload the /client/build folder via Pinata UI or Pinata SDK/API.
‚Ä¢ Pin content to ensure long-term gateway availability.

	2.	RECORD AND RETURN VALID CID
‚Ä¢ After successful upload, retrieve the new CID (expected format: Base58btc, 46 characters).
‚Ä¢ Example: QmYk8m9n0p1q2r3s4t5u6v7w8x9y0z1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i
‚Ä¢ Return CID in the following format:

‚úÖ Re-upload Complete
CID: QmXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX


	3.	UPDATE ASSETS
‚Ä¢ Replace old CID in:
	‚Ä¢	Press release v1.1
	‚Ä¢	Digest distribution package
	‚Ä¢	replit.md deployment log
	‚Ä¢	Deployment QA report
‚Ä¢ Confirm updated IPFS gateway routes are functional:
	‚Ä¢	https://ipfs.io/ipfs/[newCID]
	‚Ä¢	https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/[newCID]
	4.	TRIGGER QA RE-VALIDATION
‚Ä¢ Notify GROK of new CID.
‚Ä¢ GROK will initiate Post-Fix CID QA (Cycle A), confirm content availability, load speed, and link integrity.

‚∏ª

üì¶ DELIVERY TARGET
CID confirmation and press release update should be returned within 15‚Äì20 minutes of upload.

üß† MISSION CONTEXT
Final release and public access are blocked until this CID update is complete. This re-upload restores system-wide accessibility and unlocks public onboarding.

‚∏ª

üì° Claude, please confirm CID re-upload and return the new deployment CID to this channel. GROK is on standby to complete the final QA pass.

Standing by. üü¢
