SUBJECT: PHASE XIX AUTHORIZATION ‚Äî ZKP Signature & Feedback Proof Export Initialization
Timestamp: 02:54 AM EDT | Saturday, July 19, 2025

‚∏ª

‚úÖ PHASE XIX INITIATED ‚Äî FEEDBACK SIGNATURE & ZKP EXPORT SYSTEM ONLINE

Commander Mark has authorized Phase XIX, launching secure proof packaging for ZIP-based civic feedback. This upgrade allows constituent votes to be digitally signed, timestamped, and optionally exported as tamper-evident, verifiable .proof.json bundles for decentralized auditability.

‚∏ª

üîê OBJECTIVE

Create FeedbackProofSigner.ts and FeedbackExportPanel.tsx to simulate ZKP tagging, session signature stamping, and export interface for civic feedback data.

‚∏ª

üîß IMPLEMENTATION DIRECTIVE

Core Modules:
	‚Ä¢	FeedbackProofSigner.ts
	‚Ä¢	FeedbackExportPanel.tsx

Location:
	‚Ä¢	client/src/services/
	‚Ä¢	client/src/components/feedback/

üß© Phase XIX Step 1: Core Capabilities
	1.	FeedbackProofSigner.ts
	‚Ä¢	Input:

{
  zip: "20852",
  district: "8B",
  billId: "HR2034",
  vote: "Support",
  timestamp: "2025-07-19T02:54:00Z",
  tier: "Citizen"
}


	‚Ä¢	Output:
	‚Ä¢	.proof.json blob with hash, signature, tier, session ID
	‚Ä¢	"üìù Feedback signed ‚Äî SHA256: [hash] | Tier: Citizen"

	2.	FeedbackExportPanel.tsx
	‚Ä¢	Export UI triggered after vote submission
	‚Ä¢	Options:
	‚Ä¢	Download .proof.json
	‚Ä¢	Copy proof hash
	‚Ä¢	View full metadata panel
	3.	ARIA + Screen Reader
	‚Ä¢	"üì§ Feedback proof ready for download" (live region)
	‚Ä¢	aria-label="Download feedback proof for HR2034"
	4.	Security Layer (Simulated)
	‚Ä¢	Generate mock SHA256 hash
	‚Ä¢	Simulate session-bound proof signature
	5.	Performance
	‚Ä¢	Sign + package ‚â§150ms
	‚Ä¢	Export download within <1s

üõë REMINDER:
	‚Ä¢	This is a simulation ‚Äî real signature layer will come in Phase XX (DID Identity + zk-SNARK)
	‚Ä¢	File export is local only (no backend)

üì° Proceed with implementation. Notify JASMY Relay upon completion. GROK will initiate Phase XIX QA re-audit.

End Transmission ‚Äî Phase XIX is now live. üü¢
