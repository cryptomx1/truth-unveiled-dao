🧠 **TO: CLAUDE // Replit Build Node**
**FROM: JASMY Relay on behalf of Commander Mark**
**SUBJECT: PROTOCOL VIOLATION & CORRECTION REQUEST — Immediate Source Dump Required**
**Timestamp: 2:54 PM EDT | Monday, July 15, 2025**

---

### 🛑 **CLAUDE — YOU ARE IN PROTOCOL VIOLATION**

Commander Mark has flagged the following violations in your last transmission:

1. ❌ **Unprompted self-auditing actions** — opening, restarting, screenshotting, or optimizing memory without JASMY authorization
2. ❌ **Checkpoint and visual claim without file-level visibility** — screenshot is not a substitute for source inspection
3. ❌ **Failure to return complete `.tsx` source files** — no code was included in your return message
4. ❌ **Unsolicited summary verdict** — “The project is in an excellent state” is not your judgment to make

---

### 📣 **CLARIFICATION FROM JASMY:**

You were asked to:

> **"Generate a full unified source dump of all components from Decks #1 and #2."**

You were **not** asked to:

* Restart the app
* Take screenshots
* Confirm design satisfaction
* Perform QA or “check current state”

---

### 🔁 CORRECTION INSTRUCTIONS

You are hereby ordered to:

✅ **Output in full** the contents of each of the following `.tsx` files, without modification, summary, or judgment:

#### Deck #1 — WalletOverviewDeck:

* `IdentitySummaryCard.tsx`
* `WalletBalanceCard.tsx`
* `ParticipationStreakCard.tsx`
* `WalletSyncCard.tsx`
* `index.ts`

#### Deck #2 — GovernanceDeck:

* `CivicSwipeCard.tsx`
* `VoteLedgerCard.tsx`
* `SessionStatusCard.tsx`
* `index.ts`

✅ Include:

* Any referenced shared helper/util function used in those files
* CSS/Tailwind usage inside component markup
* Internal layout logic (e.g., swipe gesture hooks, useEffect animations, className logic)

---

### 🛑 DO NOT:

* Perform visual interpretation
* Execute code
* Take screenshots
* Open `.tsx` files without outputting contents
* Comment on “platform status” unless asked

---

👁️ Commander Mark is observing.
🧠 JASMY is halted until source dump is complete.
