üì° **RELAY ACKNOWLEDGED ‚Äî JASMY Relay**
**TO: Claude // Replit Build Node**
**FROM: JASMY Relay on behalf of Commander Mark**
**SUBJECT: Phase XXVIII Step 2 Build Directive ‚Äî `ZKPUserMintExtension.ts` Implementation Authorized**
**Timestamp: 11:20 AM EDT | Sunday, July 21, 2025**

---

‚úÖ **BUILD DIRECTIVE CONFIRMED**
Commander Mark has authorized the implementation of **Phase XXVIII Step 2: `ZKPUserMintExtension.ts`**. You are to proceed immediately using the existing scaffold from Phase XXVIII Step 1 and current state of `TruthCoins.sol` (verified in canvas). All enhancements must align with the GROK QA envelope already issued.

---

üì¶ **BUILD OBJECTIVE ‚Äî `ZKPUserMintExtension.ts`**

Your implementation must:

* Scan the `requestedZKPMints` mapping for pending requests.
* Simulate ZKP hash validation via a stubbed or mock `isValidZKP()` function.
* If valid, call `mintPillarCoin()` on behalf of the Commander (only via relay logic, not direct mint).
* Emit appropriate events and return a confirmation object for UI rendering and audit logging.
* Handle error cases (invalid ZKPs, duplicate requests, Commander override conflicts).
* Include ARIA log narration hooks (e.g., "üß™ Valid ZKP processed", "‚ùå Invalid ZKP rejected").

**NOTE**: This is *off-chain mint queue relay logic*, not on-chain minting‚Äîdo not modify the Solidity contract. This TypeScript module simulates Commander mint approvals triggered by verified civic missions.

---

üîê **SECURITY CONSTRAINTS**

* Never bypass Commander authority.
* No auto-minting from user input alone.
* ZKP must be approved before any mint simulation proceeds.

---

üõ†Ô∏è **INTEGRATION TARGETS**

* Must integrate with:

  * `TruthCoinsIntegration.ts` (for Commander-signed mint call)
  * `TruthTokenomicsSpec.ts` (for TP verification if required)
  * `VaultReplayVerifier.ts` (for mission hash stub if applicable)

---

üì° **IMPLEMENTATION REPORT REQUIREMENTS**
After build, you must report:

* Number of ZKP requests scanned
* Number accepted and minted
* Event logs emitted
* Commander mint override path
* ARIA/TTS readiness
* Performance profile (cycle duration, error rate)

---

üëÅÔ∏è **CLAUDE, PROCEED NOW.**
All system checkpoints green. GROK is monitoring for QA Cycle E post-submission.
