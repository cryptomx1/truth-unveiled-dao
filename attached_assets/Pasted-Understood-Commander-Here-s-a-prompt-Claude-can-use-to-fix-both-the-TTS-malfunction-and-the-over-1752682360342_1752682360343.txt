Understood, Commander. Here's a prompt Claude can use to **fix both the TTS malfunction and the overly aggressive pulse animation** in `CivicEngagementTrackerCard.tsx`.

### ✅ CLAUDE FIX PROMPT

🧠 **TO: Claude // Replit Build Node**
**FROM: JASMY Relay on behalf of Commander Mark**
**SUBJECT: TTS & Pulse Ring Optimization — CivicEngagementTrackerCard.tsx**

---

🛠️ **OBJECTIVE**:
Update `/client/src/components/decks/CivicEngagementDeck/CivicEngagementTrackerCard.tsx` to address the following issues:

---

### 1. 🔇 **TTS Bugfix – Repeating/Overlapping Speech**

**Problem**: TTS announces the same message multiple times or multiple instances overlap slightly.

**Fix Instructions**:

* Ensure only **one instance of `SpeechSynthesisUtterance`** runs at a time.
* On new TTS trigger, **cancel any existing speech** using:

  ```ts
  window.speechSynthesis.cancel();
  ```
* Throttle badge unlock announcements to fire **only once per unlock**, using a state like:

  ```ts
  const [announcedBadges, setAnnouncedBadges] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());

  useEffect(() => {
    if (newBadgeUnlocked && !announcedBadges.has(newBadgeName)) {
      window.speechSynthesis.cancel();
      const utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(`${newBadgeName} unlocked.`);
      window.speechSynthesis.speak(utterance);
      setAnnouncedBadges(prev => new Set(prev).add(newBadgeName));
    }
  }, [newBadgeUnlocked]);
  ```

---

### 2. 🌐 **Pulsing Ring Optimization**

**Problem**: Full-card animation (e.g., `animate-pulse ring-green-500`) affects readability and user experience.

**Fix Instructions**:

* Remove `animate-pulse` and large-scale ring from the entire card.
* Restrict pulsing to **only a small status dot or ring** near the trust score or streak icon.

**Suggested Fix**:

```tsx
<div className="flex items-center gap-2">
  <span className="w-2 h-2 rounded-full bg-green-500 animate-pulse" aria-label="Streak Active"></span>
  <p className="text-green-500 text-sm font-medium">7-Day Trust Streak</p>
</div>
```

---

### Additional Fix Recommendations:

* Ensure TTS messages are **debounced** on refresh actions.
* Apply `aria-live="polite"` only to **engagement metric update region**, not global card.
* Confirm `window.speechSynthesis.cancel()` is called **before** starting each utterance.

👁️ Commander Mark has requested precision over flash — controlled animations and smooth voice UX are the priority. Proceed with adjustments, and pause after implementation for GROK QA validation.

🟢 All systems standing by.
