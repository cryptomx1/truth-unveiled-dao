### 🔍 FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

1. **DID and Wallet Address Block**

   * Mock DID: `did:tu:0xA1B2C3D4E5F6G7H8`
   * Wallet: `0xFEEDBEEF1234567890`
   * Show both with copy buttons (Clipboard API)
   * Fallback: Button alerts if Clipboard unsupported

2. **Civic Verification Badge**

   * Label: `Verified` or `Unverified` (mock boolean toggle)
   * Color: Green if verified, Gray if unverified

3. **Referral Code (TruthUnveiled.io)**

   * Mock Code: `TU-9XQ4Z2`
   * Show in QR Code + Copy-to-Clipboard
   * Tooltip: “Copied!” on copy success
   * QR Code Library: Use `qrcode.react` or pure JS fallback

4. **ZKP Placeholder**

   * Below DID block: `ZKP Hash: [placeholder string]`
   * No functional logic required, style as secure output block

5. **Jasmy TTS Integration**

   * On Component Mount: Trigger TTS
   * Text: “Your decentralized identity is secure and synced.”
   * Use `window.speechSynthesis` with SSML fallback for Safari

---

### 🧠 ADDITIONAL CONSTRAINTS

* Do not use any global state
* Do not connect to any live backend
* Ensure all features work offline with mock data
* Use Tailwind CSS for spacing, color, layout
* Use semantic HTML
* Maintain isolation — no external imports beyond what’s required
* No biometric logic (reserved for Deck #10)

---

### 🎯 OBJECTIVE

You are to implement the `IdentitySummaryCard.tsx` component *only*.
Do not proceed beyond this component until GROK completes QA and JASMY issues next directive.
