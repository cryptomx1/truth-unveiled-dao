FROM: JASMY Relay on behalf of Commander Mark
SUBJECT: IPFS DEPLOYMENT DIRECTIVE ‚Äî Genesis Civic Genome Finalization
Timestamp: 06:14 AM EDT | Monday, July 21, 2025

‚∏ª

‚úÖ DIRECTIVE CONFIRMED
Commander Mark has authorized the initiation of IPFS Deployment Sequence for the full Truth Unveiled Civic Genome platform, including:
	‚Ä¢	20 civic decks
	‚Ä¢	Genesis Fusion Loop (/genesis-fuse)
	‚Ä¢	Vault, onboarding, feedback, and polling systems
	‚Ä¢	DAO integration and press/public modules

‚∏ª

üß† CLAUDE ‚Äî EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS
Proceed with the following tasks in sequence:

1. Build for Production
	‚Ä¢	Run a clean production build of the application using the optimized Vite (or equivalent) bundler.
	‚Ä¢	Output target: /client/dist/ or equivalent.

2. Create IPFS Deployment Script
	‚Ä¢	Script must:
	‚Ä¢	Package the /dist folder
	‚Ä¢	Authenticate with configured Pinata API keys
	‚Ä¢	Upload build directory recursively to Pinata
	‚Ä¢	Return the IPFS CID (should be CIDv1, Base32, SHA-256 multihash)

3. Pin and Log CID
	‚Ä¢	Pin the result to Pinata
	‚Ä¢	Log CID, file count, and bundle size
	‚Ä¢	Confirm gateway availability via:
	‚Ä¢	https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/[CID]
	‚Ä¢	https://ipfs.io/ipfs/[CID]

4. Update replit.md + IPFS_DEPLOYMENT_LOG.md
	‚Ä¢	Document CID, gateway links, file structure, deployment size, and timestamp.
	‚Ä¢	Append CID to /ProtocolValidator.ts or deployment registry if applicable.

5. Notify JASMY and GROK
	‚Ä¢	Relay final CID, gateway links, and logs back through JASMY for GROK QA validation.

‚∏ª

üõ°Ô∏è Validation Targets After Upload
	‚Ä¢	Verify /command, /deck/1, /vault/analyzer, /genesis-fuse all resolve
	‚Ä¢	Confirm ARIA/TTS/telemetry survive IPFS deployment
	‚Ä¢	Cross-gateway propagation must succeed within 15s (target median: <10s)

‚∏ª

üìå Claude ‚Äî Begin IPFS Deployment Sequence Now
Upon successful completion, relay CID and logs back to JASMY. GROK will initiate Phase 0-X QA Cycle B to seal deployment.

üü¢ System Clear. Awaiting CID Relay. Proceed.
