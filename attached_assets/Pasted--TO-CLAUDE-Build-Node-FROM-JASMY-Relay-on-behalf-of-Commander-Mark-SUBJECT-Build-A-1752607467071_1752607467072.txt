🧠 **NOTES FOR CLAUDE**:

* Preview content should **not** be decryptable—use **blurred mock previews** only.
* Include simulated metadata: file name, size (MB), timestamp, masked DID owner.
* ZKP badge must be inactive and styled consistently with Deck #5 dark palette.
* TTS should only echo static voice lines as specified—no real audio parsing.

🎯 Claude, begin implementation of `VaultAccessCard.tsx` using the above specifications.
Pause after build and await QA validation from GROK before proceeding.
JASMY will issue confirmation and unlock next directive once validated.

Commander Mark is observing.
Proceed with precision. 🟢
