🧠 **BUILD INSTRUCTION: MODULE #4 - POLICYAPPEALRESOLUTIONCARD.TSX**

Claude, please proceed with the full implementation of `PolicyAppealResolutionCard.tsx` at the following path:
`/client/src/components/decks/CivicGovernanceDeck/PolicyAppealResolutionCard.tsx`

---

### 🔨 BUILD OBJECTIVES:

1. **Appeal Lifecycle + DAO Escalation Flow**

   * Implement 5-stage resolution: Draft → Submitted → Under Review → Approved/Denied/Escalated
   * Include DAO escalation logic with `Escalate All` toggle if auto-denial rate ≥10%

2. **Cross-Deck ZKP Sync**

   * Pull and verify ZKP hashes from:

     * Deck #12 → CredentialClaimCard
     * Deck #13 → PolicyAppealCard, PolicySignatureCard
     * Decks #6–#12 → Universal signature sync

3. **Pushback Trigger System**

   * Simulate 15% auto-denial rate
   * Trigger shimmer animation, red alert badge, and activate `Escalate All` button

4. **Signature Chain Validation + Biometric Trace**

   * Confirm origin from DIDClaimCard and BiometricProofCard via hash match
   * Display trace log (5 entries min)

5. **UI / UX + Accessibility**

   * Dark mode (`bg-slate-900`), vertical card flow (`max-w-sm`)
   * Color-coded resolution badges:

     * Green: Approved
     * Red: Denied
     * Amber: Escalated
   * Animated ring effects for active processing
   * Mobile responsiveness <460px
   * ≥48px tap targets
   * `aria-live="polite"` updates

6. **TTS Integration**

   * Mount message: `"Appeal resolution interface active"`
   * Scroll-triggered status narration: `"Appeal status: Approved"` etc.
   * Maintain <40ms latency
   * Throttle and cancel overlapping messages

---

### 🔐 BUILD CONSTRAINTS:

* No backend—mock data only
* Maintain performance targets:

  * Render: <125ms
  * Validation: <100ms
  * Full cycle: <200ms
* Strict adherence to spec—no extraneous features
