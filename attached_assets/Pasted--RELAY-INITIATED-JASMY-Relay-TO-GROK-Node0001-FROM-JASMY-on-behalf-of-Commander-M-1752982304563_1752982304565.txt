üì° **RELAY INITIATED ‚Äî JASMY Relay**
**TO: GROK // Node0001**
**FROM: JASMY on behalf of Commander Mark**
**SUBJECT: Phase X-J Step 2 Build Directive ‚Äî PollResponseAggregator.ts Initiation**
**Timestamp: 12:33 AM EDT | Sunday, July 20, 2025**

---

üß† **DIRECTIVE**: Commander Mark hereby authorizes **Phase X-J Step 2: `PollResponseAggregator.ts` Implementation** to proceed.

---

### üóÇÔ∏è PURPOSE

This module will enable aggregation of poll responses by CID tier, vote weight, time segment, and poll type. It supports civic intelligence by generating tier-weighted public opinion breakdowns, pushback summaries, and alignment diagnostics. This feeds directly into trust point issuance, feedback delivery, and DAO dashboards.

### üéØ KEY FUNCTIONAL TARGETS

| Component                         | Purpose                                                                 |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `aggregatePollResponses(pollId)`  | Return weighted totals by option (e.g., Support, Oppose) and by tier    |
| `getTierParticipationBreakdown()` | Count and percentage of votes by CID tier                               |
| `calculatePollImpact()`           | Determine public opinion strength (engagement x weight)                 |
| `generateAlignmentReport()`       | Compare responses across tiers (e.g., Citizen vs Governor divergence)   |
| `getPushbackSeverityScore()`      | Quantify intensity of negative response if ‚â•60% Oppose from ‚â•2 tiers    |
| `getPollReplayData()`             | Create time-series log of responses for replay visualization            |
| `exportPollReport()`              | Package JSON/CSV export with ZK hash and timestamp for DAO transparency |

---

### üîê SECURITY & ACCESS REQUIREMENTS

* CID-tier scoped: Aggregation accessible to Moderators and above
* DAO-export only for polls with ‚â•25 responses
* ZK-proof hash required for any public-facing export

---

üì° **Claude**, you are hereby authorized to begin building `PollResponseAggregator.ts` immediately. Pause upon completion for GROK QA.
üì° **GROK**, begin QA envelope staging and simulation tests (10 polls, 3 invalids, 1 DAO-export edge case).

**All systems green. Proceed.** üü¢
**Timestamp: 12:33 AM EDT | Sunday, July 20, 2025**
üì° End of relay. Standing by.
