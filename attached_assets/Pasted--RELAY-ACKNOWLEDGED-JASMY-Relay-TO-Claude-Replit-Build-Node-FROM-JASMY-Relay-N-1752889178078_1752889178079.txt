üì° **RELAY ACKNOWLEDGED ‚Äî JASMY Relay**
**TO: Claude // Replit Build Node**
**FROM: JASMY // Relay Node on behalf of Commander Mark**
**SUBJECT: Phase XII Activation Directive ‚Äî Truth Trace Engine Initialization**
**Timestamp: 09:34 PM EDT | Friday, July 18, 2025**

---

üß≠ **PHASE XII ‚Äî TRUTH TRACE ENGINE INITIATION**
Commander Mark hereby authorizes the full initiation of **Phase XII: Truth Trace Engine** ‚Äî the next evolution of civic memory logic, enabling **timeline-wide state tracing**, memory chain visualization, and **reverse-impact analytics**.

This engine introduces real-time tracing of user-invoked memory events across decks and provides groundwork for future modules including **Constituent Trust Graphs**, **Temporal Sentiment Trails**, and **ZKP-verified Proof of Engagement threads**.

---

### üß† **CORE OBJECTIVES**

1. **TraceChainRegistry.ts**

   * Maintain an immutable, ordered map of all replayed actions (session + persistent)
   * Structure: `[{ actionId, timestamp, sourceDeck, moduleId, effectHash }]`
   * Hashing via `generateTraceFingerprint(action: MemoryReplayEvent)`

2. **DeckImpactGraph.tsx**

   * Visual timeline graph linking memory actions across decks
   * Allow toggling ‚ÄúImpact Radius‚Äù to view 1-hop, 2-hop, and full trace paths
   * Use `VictoryGraph` or fallback SVG for visualization

3. **ReverseImpactAnalyzer.ts**

   * For a given memory replay, scan previous session logs for actions that influenced its outcome
   * Display causal chain with ARIA live narrations (e.g., ‚ÄúThis mission was unlocked due to completing the CivicOnboarding deck and verifying your wallet.‚Äù)

4. **TruthTracePanel**

   * Sidebar panel accessed from Memory tab
   * Displays chronological or causal view of memory actions
   * Interactive: Clicking entries loads deck/module and triggers highlight glow

5. **ZKPTraceProof.ts**

   * For each replayed action, optionally export `traceProof.json`:

     * Includes timestamp, deck/module, user hash, effect hash, and signed signature
     * Button to ‚ÄúüìÑ View Zero-Knowledge Proof of Trace‚Äù with `CopyToClipboard` and `Download`

### üß™ **QA TARGETS (POST-BUILD)**

| Component             | Target Behavior                               |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| TraceChainRegistry    | Correct ordering, hashing, session-persistent |
| DeckImpactGraph       | Renders trace hops, toggles radius            |
| ReverseImpactAnalyzer | Backtracks influence chain, narrates ARIA     |
| TruthTracePanel       | Fully navigable, ARIA-compliant               |
| ZKPTraceProof         | Generates valid exportable proof blob         |

---

üìé **Post-Build Tasks**

* GROK will issue a ZKP integrity test plan across 3 decks
* Commander Mark will later trigger `TrustFeedbackEngine` overlays using this backbone
* Do not initiate Phase XIII until Phase XII is sealed

---

üö¶ **BUILD STATUS: GREEN**
Claude, you are cleared to initiate **Phase XII: Truth Trace Engine** now.
Begin implementation of the 5 modules above in isolated commits and relay confirmation when complete.

üì° **FORWARD TO CLAUDE** ‚Äî JASMY Relay standing by.
