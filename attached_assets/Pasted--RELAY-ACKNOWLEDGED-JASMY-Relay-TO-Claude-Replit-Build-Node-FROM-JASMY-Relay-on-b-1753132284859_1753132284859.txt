**SUBJECT: Implementation Authorization ‚Äî Civic Fusion Cycle Phase 1 Build Directive**
**Timestamp: 11:40 PM EDT | Tuesday, July 23, 2025**

---

‚úÖ **CLAUDE, YOU ARE NOW AUTHORIZED TO PROCEED WITH PHASE 1 OF THE CIVIC FUSION CYCLE.**

This relay confirms that QA pre-staging by GROK has been sealed for the **Civic Fusion Cycle**, integrating:

* Phase X-M ‚Üí Guardian onboarding + pillar selection
* Phase 0-X ‚Üí TP-based fusion + badge binding
* Phase XXVIII ‚Üí ZKP mint initiation + verification

You are now cleared to implement **Civic Fusion Cycle ‚Äî Step 1: Onboarding Validation**.

---

## üî® CLAUDE BUILD INSTRUCTIONS ‚Äî STEP 1 COMPONENTS

**1. CivicFusionRouter.tsx**
Create a parent route wrapper for the new cycle:
`/fusion` ‚Üí contains child paths for dashboard, status, onboarding.

**2. CivicMissionOnboardingCard.tsx**
Refactor with embedded CID-tier detection. Mission buttons must only activate if the CID tier is eligible (‚â•Citizen). Route to `/fusion/onboarding/:missionId`.

**3. CivicCompass.tsx**
Upon mission selection, load pillar recommendations. Ensure ARIA narration:

* ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve selected \[MISSION]. Recommended Pillar: \[PILLAR] Guardian: \[GUARDIAN].‚Äù
* Example mapping: Voice ‚Üí Governance ‚Üí Athena

**4. FusionEligibilityGate.tsx**
Reusable component that checks TP from vault. If <500 TP, display ARIA:

> ‚ÄúFusion threshold not yet reached. Earn more Truth Points.‚Äù
> If ‚â•500 TP, unlock route `/fusion/request`.

**5. Route Activation**
Ensure `/fusion/onboarding`, `/fusion/status`, and `/fusion/request` are registered in `App.tsx`. All routes must include ARIA regions and mobile support <460px.

üõë **Claude**, pause upon completion of **Step 1** and await GROK QA audit.
Do not proceed to Step 2 (TP Verification + Mint UI) until authorized.
Ensure full ARIA compliance and telemetry logging in all components.

üß† Claude, your performance on this fusion cycle will become the foundation for the **Genesis DAO Identity Loop**. Precision is critical.
