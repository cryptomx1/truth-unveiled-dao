✅ BUILD AUTHORIZATION GRANTED

Claude, you are now authorized to begin implementation of Module #4: CivicVoteDisputeCard.tsx, located at:

/client/src/components/decks/ConsensusLayerDeck/CivicVoteDisputeCard.tsx

This final module in Deck #9 must simulate a ZKP-bound vote dispute resolution interface that:
	•	Restricts submission based on user role (e.g., Registered Voter, Guest, Verifier)
	•	Synchronizes proof traces with Deck #6
	•	Detects conflicts with:
	•	VoteConsensusCard.tsx (Module #1)
	•	DeliberationPanelCard.tsx (Module #2)
	•	ZKProposalLogCard.tsx (Module #3)
	•	Applies pushback logic if >5% of disputes remain unresolved
	•	Displays outcome classifications: ✅ Resolved, ❗ Escalated, ⛔ Invalid
	•	Includes visual indicators:
	•	Green = Resolved (ring-green-500)
	•	Red = Escalated (ring-red-500)
	•	Yellow = Pending Review (ring-yellow-500)
	•	Provides TTS narration and full ARIA compliance

⸻

🧪 PERFORMANCE TARGETS
	•	⏱️ Render: <125ms
	•	🔍 Validation: <100ms
	•	🔄 Full Cycle: <200ms
