**SUBJECT: Phase XIV Activation Directive — Civic Trust Pulse Deployment**
**Timestamp: 10:34 PM EDT | Friday, July 18, 2025**

---

🧭 **PHASE XIV — CIVIC TRUST PULSE DEPLOYMENT**
Commander Mark now authorizes **Phase XIV**, the deployment of the **Civic Trust Pulse System**, building upon the ZKP-backed feedback infrastructure of Phase XIII to create **real-time, anonymized trust heatmaps**, **cross-user pulse synthesis**, and **deck-tier volatility indicators**.

This pulse layer will deliver civic transparency to users by surfacing live trust dynamics, visual feedback waves, and contextual impact signals across decks and modules.

---

### 🧠 **PHASE XIV MODULE OBJECTIVES**

#### 1. `TrustPulseWidget.tsx`

* Real-time indicator in deck headers
* Displays current pulse as:

  * 🟢 “Aligned” (trust > 70%)
  * 🟡 “Mixed” (trust 30–70%)
  * 🔴 “Unstable” (trust < 30%)
* Hover/click reveals feedback streak graph (24h / 7d / 30d)

#### 2. `PulseAggregationEngine.ts`

* Aggregates feedbackVault entries across users (simulated multi-user mode)
* Computes trust sentiment vector and volatility index per deck

#### 3. `DeckVolatilityOverlay.tsx`

* Gradient bar overlay for decks showing pulse strength + volatility
* Tooltip on hover: "Trust Flux: +12.3% / -8.1% | 24h"

#### 4. `CivicPulseAPI.ts` (simulated)

* Fetches synthetic trust data from mock multi-user system
* Supports endpoints: `/pulse/:deckId`, `/volatility/:deckId`, `/trend/:deckId/:period`

#### 5. `PulseNarrationNode.ts`

* Periodically announces pulse status changes using ARIA live regions
* Example: “Trust Pulse on Deck #12: CivicIdentity now stable”

### 🧪 **QA TARGETS POST-BUILD**

| Component              | Expected Behavior                                              |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TrustPulseWidget       | Deck-level pulse state, streak graph toggle, hover interaction |
| PulseAggregationEngine | Accurate pulse aggregation from simulated feedback data        |
| DeckVolatilityOverlay  | Visual overlay gradient matches trust flux index               |
| CivicPulseAPI          | Endpoint calls resolve mock data correctly                     |
| PulseNarrationNode     | ARIA live narrations on pulse status change                    |

---

📎 **Integration Notes**

* TrustPulseWidget must appear in **Decks #1, #3, #9, #12**
* Simulated API must include at least 5 users’ feedback data (mock)
* Streak graphs must use SVG or Canvas for performance
* Narration interval = every 60 seconds or on change ≥ ±10%

🚦 **BUILD STATUS: GREEN**
Claude, you are cleared to initiate **Phase XIV: Civic Trust Pulse Deployment** now.
Build all five modules and notify JASMY when complete for QA Cycle A.
