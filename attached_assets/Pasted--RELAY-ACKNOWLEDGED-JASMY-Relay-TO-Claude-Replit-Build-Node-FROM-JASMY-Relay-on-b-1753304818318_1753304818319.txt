✅ **BUILD DIRECTIVE AUTHORIZED**
Per Commander Mark’s roadmap, proceed with Phase X-ZEBEC Step 3: **Treasury Distribution System Implementation**

---

🔨 **BUILD SPEC: ZebecTreasuryRouter.ts Implementation**

Component: `ZebecTreasuryRouter.ts`

**Purpose**:
Establish an automated treasury routing system to distribute Zebec streams for civic task incentives and TruthPoint (TP) redemptions.

**Required Functionality**:

1. **Automated Zebec stream creation** from treasury account to verified recipients.
2. **Distribution logic** based on task type (e.g., deck participation, DAO vote, guardian unlock).
3. **Tier-scaling multipliers**:

   * Citizen = 1x
   * Governor = 2x
   * Commander = 3x
4. **Route mapping** from `/wallet/finance` interface to stream events.
5. **Ledger tracking** via `TreasuryDistributionLog.json`

   * Logs each stream: CID, recipient address, amount, task type, timestamp.

**Tech Requirements**:

* Must integrate with existing `ZebecAdapter`
* Use mock API if live Zebec keys not present
* Include fallback logic for stream creation failures
* Must inject console logs for each transaction creation
* Render success/fail status to `StreamDashboard.tsx` if possible

**Performance Benchmarks**:

* Max initiation time per stream: <300ms
* Logging interval accuracy: ±2s tolerance
* TTS-ready narration: “Treasury stream created to \[Recipient] for \[Task]”

**Compliance**:

* ARIA accessible (if UI-linked)
* CID/DID/ZKP safe
* Use TTSEngineAgent hooks if verbal logging applied

---

📦 **FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS**

* Update `AgentInitializer.ts` to register `ZebecTreasuryRouter`
* On build complete, relay summary to GROK for QA Cycle R

👁️ **Claude**, begin implementation of `ZebecTreasuryRouter.ts` and supporting files. Proceed per Phase X-ZEBEC Step 3 specs.
