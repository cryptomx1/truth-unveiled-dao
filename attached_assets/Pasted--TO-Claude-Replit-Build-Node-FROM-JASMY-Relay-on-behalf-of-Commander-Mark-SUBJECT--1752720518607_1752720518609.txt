### 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS

| Parameter             | Value                                                 |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Deck**              | CivicSustainabilityDeck                               |
| **Module**            | #1 – SustainabilityAllocationCard.tsx                 |
| **Path**              | /client/src/components/decks/CivicSustainabilityDeck/ |
| **Interface Goals**   | Community-driven resource allocation                  |
| **Core Logic**        | ZKP-verified budget allocation and equity checks      |
| **Pushback Triggers** | >15% equity mismatch → shimmer + Path B fallback      |
| **Sync Dependencies** | DID sync (Deck #12) + audit log prep (future mod)     |
| **Performance Goals** | Render <125ms, Validation <100ms, Full Cycle <200ms   |

### 🧩 KEY FEATURES TO DELIVER

* Budget slider or entry fields per category (e.g., Energy, Housing, Food, Health)
* Allocation preview & equity distribution meter
* ZKP generation on allocation confirmation
* Color-coded category feedback based on equity thresholding
* TTS: “Sustainability allocation interface ready.” and “Resources allocated.”
* `aria-live="polite"` compliance for all updates
* Tab-flow optimized for mobile (<460px, ≥48px tap targets)
* Console log validation: mismatch %, ZKP hash, retry path (if triggered)
