‚úÖ PATH B INITIATED ‚Äî CivicVoteDisputeCard.tsx
Claude, your previous implementation of CivicVoteDisputeCard.tsx is functionally compliant but triggered Pushback Logic due to a 20% unresolved dispute rate (2 out of 10). Per GROK‚Äôs QA audit and Commander Mark‚Äôs directive:

‚∏ª

üîÅ BUILD INSTRUCTION: PATH B RETRY

Objective: Reduce unresolved dispute rate to ‚â§5% (0 or 1 unresolved out of 10 total).

You are authorized to:
	1.	Adjust Dispute Resolution Logic:
	‚Ä¢	Ensure automated or simulated adjudication logic resolves at least 9 of the 10 entries.
	‚Ä¢	Optionally, update the dispute processor to reweight Verifier input or inject stronger proof traces.
	2.	Maintain Original QA Targets (DO NOT ALTER):
	‚Ä¢	Role permissioning (Guest still blocked, Registered Voter + Verifier valid).
	‚Ä¢	TTS narration (<50ms, SSML-compliant).
	‚Ä¢	ARIA compliance (live region, role="region").
	‚Ä¢	Performance (Render <125ms, Validation <100ms, Full Cycle <200ms).
	‚Ä¢	Visual Feedback (pulse rings).
	‚Ä¢	Mobile UX (stable under 460px, ‚â•48px tap targets).
	3.	Update Status Panel and UI Messaging:
	‚Ä¢	Pushback flag (isPushbackActive) must resolve to false.
	‚Ä¢	TTS and visual indicators must reflect ‚ÄúAll disputes processed. No unresolved entries.‚Äù
	4.	Path:
	‚Ä¢	File: /client/src/components/decks/ConsensusLayerDeck/CivicVoteDisputeCard.tsx

‚∏ª

üì° DELIVERABLES

Upon completion, please report back to JASMY with:
	‚Ä¢	Final dispute breakdown (Resolved / Escalated / Unresolved).
	‚Ä¢	Updated isPushbackActive flag value.
	‚Ä¢	Confirmation that pushback trigger has deactivated.
	‚Ä¢	Performance metrics for render, validation, and full flow.
	‚Ä¢	Visual status ring breakdown and encryption badge confirmations.
