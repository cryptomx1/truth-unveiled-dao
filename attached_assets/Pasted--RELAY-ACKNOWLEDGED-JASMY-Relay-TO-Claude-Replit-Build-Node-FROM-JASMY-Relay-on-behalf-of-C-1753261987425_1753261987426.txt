ðŸŸ¢ BUILD AUTHORIZATION: APPROVED

Claude, you are authorized to proceed with Phase TTS-CIVIC-ENHANCE Step 2, which includes enhancement of text-to-speech voice quality and the implementation of robust fallback protocols to ensure platform-wide narration consistency.

â¸»

ðŸŽ¯ IMPLEMENTATION OBJECTIVES

You must deliver the following:
	1.	LLM Voice Quality Upgrade Logic
	â€¢	Integrate VoiceProviderSelector.ts to dynamically evaluate available TTS providers (OpenAI, Play.ht, WellSaid Labs, Google Cloud TTS).
	â€¢	Prioritize voice clarity, latency, and emotion accuracy.
	â€¢	Match tone to deck context using DeckNarrationConfig.json.
	2.	Fallback Protocol & Priority Chain
	â€¢	Implement TTSFallbackEngine.ts to manage:
	â€¢	Primary: OpenAI GPT-4o Voice
	â€¢	Secondary: Play.ht (if latency < 600ms)
	â€¢	Tertiary: Google WaveNet or Browser TTS (if all else fails)
	â€¢	Use VoiceFallbackLog.json to log fallback invocations.
	3.	Agent Diagnostic Telemetry
	â€¢	Enhance TTSDiagnosticReport.json with:
	â€¢	Voice selection metadata
	â€¢	Latency metrics
	â€¢	Fallback frequency summary
	â€¢	Deck-level success rate (TTS enabled/working)
	4.	New Components to Deliver
	â€¢	VoiceProviderSelector.ts
	â€¢	TTSFallbackEngine.ts
	â€¢	VoiceFallbackLog.json (diagnostic)
	â€¢	Updates to TTSEngineAgent.ts and AgentInitializer.ts
	5.	Deck Test Targets
	â€¢	Ensure coverage in Deck 1, Deck 2, Deck 10, Deck 13, and Deck 20
	â€¢	Each must render TTS toggle, select proper voice, and fallback gracefully if needed

â¸»

ðŸ“¦ REFERENCE FILES
	â€¢	DeckNarrationConfig.json
	â€¢	TTSEngineAgent.ts (modify)
	â€¢	TTSToggle.tsx (ensure toggle routes voice requests via selector)

ðŸ§  ADDITIONAL CONSTRAINTS
	â€¢	Avoid re-downloading voice assets on every interaction.
	â€¢	Maintain under 500ms response for primary and 850ms for fallback.
	â€¢	Filter out all CID, DID, ZIP, and ZKP references from audio content.
