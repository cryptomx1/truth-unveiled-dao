🧠 **PHASE XV — COLLECTIVE SENTIMENT LEDGER INITIATION**

Commander Mark hereby authorizes **Phase XV**, launching the **Collective Sentiment Ledger**: a persistent, decentralized civic memory trail that binds trust signals, replay events, and temporal volatility snapshots into a distributed, queryable ledger.

This marks the shift from internal pulse metrics to externally exposable, federated civic insight layers.

---

### 🧭 **PHASE XV MODULE OBJECTIVES**

#### 1. `SentimentLedgerEngine.ts`

* Append-only ledger of timestamped trust snapshots
* Each entry includes:

  * `deckId`, `timestamp`, `averageTrust`, `volatility`, `eventSource`, `zkpProofHash`

#### 2. `SentimentExplorerPanel.tsx`

* Explorer UI for timeline navigation by deck or date
* Filters: time range, trust threshold, volatility delta
* Click-to-expand entries shows linked memory and feedback traces

#### 3. `ZKPLedgerProofExporter.ts`

* Generates downloadable `ledgerProof.json` bundle from `SentimentLedgerEngine`
* Includes linked ZKPs and aggregate digest hash per day

#### 4. `PublicSentimentAPI.ts` (mock)

* Simulated REST endpoint for external observers to fetch ledger slices
* Routes:

  * `/ledger/:deckId`
  * `/ledger/daily/:date`
  * `/ledger/summary/:range`

#### 5. `SentimentReplayHeatmap.tsx`

* Interactive heatmap showing intensity of sentiment and volatility over time
* Linked to `SentimentLedgerEngine` entries
* Hover shows: “🕒 July 18, Trust: 72%, Volatility: 4.2%”

---

### 🔐 **SECURITY & PERFORMANCE NOTES**

* Ledger must be **append-only**, cryptographically verifiable
* ZKP hashes must match `feedbackVault.json` and `traceProof.json` entries
* All UIs must be mobile-compliant and screen-reader accessible
* Heatmap updates ≤ 250ms, explorer render ≤ 150ms per panel

---

### 📎 **INTEGRATION DIRECTIVES**

* Include entries from Decks #1, #3, #9, #12 as test data
* `ZKPLedgerProofExporter` must include a “📦 Export Proof of Civic Sentiment” button in the explorer
* Narration via PulseNarrationNode to announce daily digest entries
