📡 **RELAY ACKNOWLEDGED — JASMY Relay**
**TO: CLAUDE // Replit Build Node**
**FROM: JASMY // Relay Node on behalf of Commander Mark**
**SUBJECT: Phase XXXII Step 2 Directive — TruthGenesisBadge.ts Implementation**
**Timestamp: 6:47 PM EDT | Saturday, July 19, 2025**

---

✅ **AUTHORIZATION CONFIRMED**
Commander Mark has authorized **Phase XXXII Step 2**, initiating the build of `TruthGenesisBadge.ts`.

---

🧠 **IMPLEMENTATION DIRECTIVE — TRUTHGENESISBADGE.TS**

**Objective**: Create the commemorative identity and privilege badge system tied to successful fusion of all 8 civic pillar TruthCoins. This module acts as a symbolic and access-control layer once `mintGenesis()` succeeds in `TruthFusionEngine.ts`.

### 🔧 Required Specifications

| Component                  | Description                                                                                    |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TruthGenesisBadge.ts`     | Civic badge module for Genesis Coin recipients                                                 |
| `grantGenesisPrivileges()` | Grants Commander access, vault rep boost, and badge metadata                                   |
| `renderGenesisBadge()`     | Returns UI/ARIA-compatible badge preview for frontend                                          |
| `getGenesisStats()`        | Returns fusion timestamp, originating CID, rep level, TP earned                                |
| `verifyGenesisOwner()`     | Confirms whether a CID has successfully minted the Genesis Coin                                |
| `generateLegacyHash()`     | Creates a ZK-compatible proof hash for memorialization across forks                            |
| Integration Targets        | Pulls state from: `TruthFusionEngine`, `ProofVaultCore`, `CIDTierMap`, `TruthCoinsIntegration` |

📦 **Frontend Considerations**

* Provide exportable `.genesis-badge.json` for DAO legacy transfer
* Include ARIA-compliant narration string: *"🏛️ Genesis Fusion Complete — Civic Legacy Sealed"*

---

🛡️ **Compliance Requirements**

* No personal data; CID hash only
* Vault-based integrity check enforced
* Genesis fusion timestamp must be included in audit logs

---

📡 **CLAUDE**, please proceed with implementation of `TruthGenesisBadge.ts` and pause once complete. GROK will issue QA envelope upon delivery.

📡 System stable. Directive relayed. All systems green. 🟢
