SUBJECT: PHASE XI-E AUTHORIZATION — Modular Translation Coverage Directive
Timestamp: 12:09 AM EDT | Saturday, July 19, 2025

⸻

✅ PHASE XI-E INITIATED — FULL CIVIC MODULE LOCALIZATION DEPLOYMENT

Commander Mark has authorized Phase XI-E, extending the translation system to cover all primary civic cards and modular decks. This ensures a fully multilingual user experience across the Truth Unveiled interface, preparing the platform for scale, accessibility compliance, and cross-cultural civic onboarding.

⸻

🌐 OBJECTIVE

Refactor all remaining UI-facing civic modules and cards to adopt t('key') with dynamic dictionary access.

⸻

🔧 IMPLEMENTATION DIRECTIVE

Target Modules (Minimum Refactor Set):
	•	FeedbackCard.tsx
	•	GovernanceCard.tsx
	•	IdentityCard.tsx
	•	DeckPreviewCard.tsx
	•	Any shared tooltip, button, or alert component with static English strings

⸻

🧩 Core Tasks to Perform:
	1.	t(key) Integration
	•	Replace all hardcoded strings with t('key') in each module
	•	Ensure keys exist in en.json, es.json, fr.json
	•	Fallback logic for missing keys must remain active
	2.	New Keysets
	•	Examples:
	•	"button.submit" → “Submit / Enviar / Soumettre”
	•	"card.feedback.description" → localized deck blurbs
	•	"tier.moderator" → “Moderator / Moderador / Modérateur”
	3.	ARIA Localization
	•	Translate any aria-label or aria-describedby values in UI
	•	All assistive strings must reflect current selected language
	4.	LangContext Sync Verification
	•	Confirm that all updated modules still reflect real-time language changes
	•	Use useLang() and t() uniformly across components
	5.	Visual Confirmation + Console Telemetry
	•	Console log when component detects language switch:
"🈳 Module re-rendered in: [lang]" (e.g., "🈳 FeedbackCard re-rendered in: fr")

📦 TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

Category	Target
Commit Title	MODULAR_TRANSLATION_COVERAGE_PHASE_XI_E
Push Location	client/src/components/decks/ and client/src/components/common/
Console Logs	

	•	"🈳 FeedbackCard re-rendered in: ES"
	•	"⚠️ Missing translation: card.identity.title" |
| Performance | Render update on toggle ≤200ms; fallback resolution ≤10ms |
| Localization Accuracy | All key translations must match test dictionary entries |

⸻

🛑 REMINDER:
	•	This is a live refactor phase — no UI changes allowed outside of string substitution
	•	Phase XII will handle multilingual proposal logs, ZKP overlay labels, and DID-based dynamic switching

📡 Proceed with implementation. Notify JASMY Relay upon completion. GROK will initiate Phase XI-E QA re-audit.

End Transmission — Phase XI-E is now active. 🟢
