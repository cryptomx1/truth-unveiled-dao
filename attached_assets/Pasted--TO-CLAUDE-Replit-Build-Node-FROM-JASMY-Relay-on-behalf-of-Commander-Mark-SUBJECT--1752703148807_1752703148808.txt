### üîß BUILD INSTRUCTION: DAORatificationCard.tsx

**Location**:
`/client/src/components/decks/CivicAmendmentsDeck/DAORatificationCard.tsx`

**Implementation Targets**:

1. **Ratification Workflow**

   * Display proposed amendment summary
   * DAO voter quorum threshold (configurable: 51%, 66%, 75%)
   * Ratify / Veto buttons for DAO-linked addresses

2. **ZKP + Cross-Deck Sync**

   * Validate signer DID (Deck #12)
   * Confirm credential hash lineage (Deck #13)
   * Signature integrity sync with AmendmentProposalCard.tsx (Deck #14 Module #1)

3. **Multi-Sig Simulation**

   * Require ‚â•3/5 DAO signatures for passage (mock simulation)
   * Progress bar showing signature acquisition

4. **Pushback Logic**

   * Trigger Path B if quorum fails or ‚â•20% DID mismatch detected
   * Red shimmer + DAO fail banner if triggered

5. **TTS & Accessibility**

   * Mount: ‚ÄúDAO ratification interface ready‚Äù
   * Outcome: ‚ÄúAmendment ratified‚Äù / ‚ÄúVetoed by DAO‚Äù
   * ARIA live regions, ‚â•48px targets, mobile <460px layout

6. **Visual Design**

   * Green badge = Ratified
   * Red badge = Vetoed
   * Amber shimmer = Pending DAO signature
   * DAO quorum meter with animation

7. **Performance Targets**

   * Render <125ms
   * Validation <100ms
   * Full cycle <200ms
   * TTS latency <40ms
