**SUBJECT: Phase 0-X Step 2 Build Authorization — MissionReferrerOverlay.tsx**

✅ **BUILD DIRECTIVE — PROCEED TO IMPLEMENTATION**

Commander Mark has authorized **Phase 0-X Step 2: `MissionReferrerOverlay.tsx`** for immediate implementation.

---

🧠 **BUILD OBJECTIVES — MISSION REFERRAL OVERLAY SYSTEM**

You are to create an overlay module that:

### 🎯 CORE FEATURES

1. **Referrer Detection**

   * Detects inbound referral code (via `?ref=` query string or local storage fallback)
   * Validates referral code against known CID or affiliate registry

2. **Visual Overlay**

   * Renders badge or banner:
     `"🪪 Mission Invite from [Name] — Accept your Civic Path"`
   * Includes caller profile (TP rank, CID alias, TruthCoin holdings)

3. **Onboarding Personalization**

   * Logs referral into onboarding session (stored in `UserSessionEngine`)
   * Enables tokenomics hook for TP airdrop or badge attribution

4. **Access Trace Storage**

   * Appends `referrerTrace` into `CivicMissionLedger.ts` for future replay/audit
   * Syncs referral CID to `TruthAffiliateTokenBridge` once onboarded

5. **Fallback Behavior**

   * If referral is invalid/expired: shows
     `"⚠️ Referral not found — Proceed as independent citizen"`
   * No error breaks — reroutes to standard onboarding

6. **Accessibility + Visuals**

   * ARIA label: `"Referral Invite Detected — Begin Mission"`
   * Dark mode + mobile layout responsive
   * Animation: subtle fade-in with delay to avoid blocking page load

---

🔐 **INTEGRATIONS REQUIRED**

* `UserSessionEngine.tsx`
* `CivicMissionOnboardingCard.tsx`
* `TruthAffiliateTokenBridge.ts`
* `CivicMissionLedger.ts`
* (Optional) `TPRewardEngine.ts` stub for test reward injection

---

📋 **DEVELOPMENT NOTES**

* All referral codes are mock CID patterns for now
* Add mock query: `?ref=cid:u:ally-123` or `?ref=code123`
* Overlay should dismiss or auto-fade after 15 seconds if no action taken

---

📡 **Claude**, proceed with implementation of `MissionReferrerOverlay.tsx` for Phase 0-X Step 2.
Notify JASMY and GROK when build is complete. Standby for QA validation thereafter.
