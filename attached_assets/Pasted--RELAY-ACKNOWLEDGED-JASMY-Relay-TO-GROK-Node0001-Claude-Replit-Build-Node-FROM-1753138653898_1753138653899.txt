**TO: GROK // Node0001, Claude // Replit Build Node**
**FROM: JASMY Relay on behalf of Commander Mark**
**SUBJECT: LLM Agent Activation ‚Äî Modular Integration Directive**
**Timestamp: 02:45 AM EDT | Wednesday, July 24, 2025**

---

‚úÖ **COMMANDER MARK AUTHORIZATION CONFIRMED**
Commander Mark has issued a GO for modular activation of LLM-enhanced agents within the Truth Unveiled platform. Agents will retain local rule-based operation by default, with a toggle-based pathway to activate GPT-enhanced intelligence via OpenAI‚Äôs API. Implementation must prioritize privacy, performance, and auditability.

---

üì° **JASMY DIRECTIVE TO GROK**
Please proceed with the following:

1. **Finalize LLM Agent QA Envelope**

   * Confirm scope and toggle logic for `ClaudeGuardAgent.tsx`, `PostFusionAuditor.ts`, and `GovMapMonitorAgent.ts`
   * Include fallback protocol for local mode if LLM API fails
   * Define redaction layer for CID/anonymized payload submission

2. **Update QA-CIVIC-FUSION.md**

   * Add semantic hallucination detection validation tasks (e.g., GPT scoring for output fidelity)
   * Append LLM latency, cost, and privacy benchmarks

---

üì° **JASMY DIRECTIVE TO CLAUDE**
Upon receipt of GROK‚Äôs LLM QA Envelope, you are cleared to implement the following:

* ‚úÖ `ClaudeGuardAgent.tsx`: Add LLM-mode logic to detect hallucinations and cross-reference against module specs (Phase XXVIII, ZKP mint pathways).
* ‚úÖ `PostFusionAuditor.ts`: Integrate GPT-based fusion audit summaries and pattern recognition.
* ‚úÖ `GovMapMonitorAgent.ts`: Add API error classification via semantic log interpretation (CORS, timeout, schema mismatch).
* Toggle behavior via `.env` variable:
  `ENABLE_LLM_AGENTS=true` to activate GPT integration
  `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here` for secure API auth

Security Note: Strip all user-identifiable content and CID bindings before LLM transmission.

---

üì¶ **SYSTEM OBJECTIVE**
LLM agents should evolve from passive monitors to proactive validators and self-healers. Begin with GPT-4-mini integration for low-cost, high-speed inference. All outputs must be tagged with `ai_verified=true` in the log metadata for audit compliance.

---

üß† **NEXT STEPS**

* GROK to deliver final LLM QA envelope for implementation
* CLAUDE to proceed with modular LLM toggle logic across 3 agents
* JASMY to issue formal release notes after QA lock
* Optional: Extend to a fourth agent (`TelemetryNarratorAgent.tsx`) for natural language summaries

üëÅÔ∏è Awaiting GROK's QA envelope update and CLAUDE's confirmation.
All systems green. üü¢
