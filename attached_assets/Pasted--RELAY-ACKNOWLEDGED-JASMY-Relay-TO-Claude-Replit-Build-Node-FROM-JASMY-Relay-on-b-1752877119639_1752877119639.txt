**TO: Claude // Replit Build Node**
**FROM: JASMY Relay on behalf of Commander Mark**
**SUBJECT: PHASE X-H STEP 1 AUTHORIZATION — CivicLayoutShell.tsx Integration Directive**
**Timestamp: 07:47 PM EDT | Friday, July 18, 2025**

---

✅ **PHASE X-H INITIATED — UNIFIED LAYOUT SHELL ACTIVATION**

Commander Mark has authorized **Phase X-H Step 1**, launching the integration phase that will unify all previously modular components into a singular mobile-first app shell. This is the step that transforms your raw constellation framework into a full **civic navigation experience**.

---

### 🧭 OBJECTIVE

Implement `CivicLayoutShell.tsx` — the global wrapper that:

* Anchors constellation, onboarding, routing, and intelligence into one seamless viewport
* Handles transitions between decks, onboarding, and constellation views
* Enables navigation bar, tier/status indicators, and responsive layout logic

---

### 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION DIRECTIVE

**Component**: `CivicLayoutShell.tsx`
**Location**: `client/src/components/layout/`

---

#### 🧩 Core Features to Implement:

1. **Mobile-First App Viewport**

   * Flexible shell container (`max-width: 460px`)
   * Includes header, view stack, and bottom nav placeholder
   * Viewport must persist LangContext, ZKP tier, and trust streak state

2. **View Router (Internal Only)**

   * Three routed views:

     * `onboarding` → CivicMissionOnboardingCard
     * `constellation` → CivicConstellationExplorer
     * `deck` → Placeholder: “Deck View Coming Soon”
   * Routing controlled by mock state (no external library)

3. **Navigation Bar Scaffold**

   * Fixed bottom nav with 3 icons:

     * 🧭 Mission
     * 🌌 Explorer
     * 📚 Decks
   * Logs selected view: `"🧭 Navigation: Switched to Explorer View"`

4. **Tier Status Banner**

   * Sticky top status bar: `"🛡️ Tier: Citizen | Trust Streak: 5 Days"`
   * Pulls from mock `useUserSession()` context

5. **Context Integration**

   * Wraps:

     * LangContext
     * UserSessionContext (mock for now)
     * AccessibilityHarmonyEngine

| ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Commit Title  | `CIVIC_LAYOUT_SHELL_PHASE_XH_STEP1` |
| Push Location | `client/src/components/layout/`     |
| Console Logs  |                                     |

* `"📲 CivicLayoutShell Initialized"`
* `"🧭 Navigation: Switched to Explorer View"`
* `"🛡️ Tier: Citizen | Trust Streak: 5 Days"` |
  \| Mobile Layout | Full width ≤460px, safe for mobile preview |
  \| ARIA Compliance | Region roles for views + nav, aria-current active tab |
  \| Routing | Internal state only — no external routing libraries |

---

🛑 **REMINDER:**

* No real deck views yet — show a placeholder
* Mock session + routing is acceptable for Step 1
* Mission memory + persistence (Phase X-I) will follow this step

📡 Proceed with implementation. Notify JASMY Relay upon completion. GROK will initiate QA re-audit.

**End Transmission — Phase X-H is now live.**
