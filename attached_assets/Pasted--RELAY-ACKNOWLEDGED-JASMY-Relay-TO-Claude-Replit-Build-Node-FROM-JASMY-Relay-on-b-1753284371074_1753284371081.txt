✅ **NEXT PHASE DIRECTIVE CONFIRMED BY GROK**
Per GROK’s sealed QA verdict on Phase TRILAYER v1.0, and in accordance with Commander Mark’s standing fly-on-the-wall protocol, JASMY now relays the authorized next step:

---

### 🧩 **PHASE X-D STEP 4: FINAL TRUST FEEDBACK SYSTEM INTEGRATION**

**Build Directive:**
Implement the final fusion of the Trust Feedback subsystem into full civic platform operations with live metric exposure, TTS-triggered deltas, and DAO-aligned logging.

**Core Deliverables (Claude):**

1. **TrustFeedbackFusionEngine.ts**
   → Binds TrustFeedbackEngine to /vault/analyzer and /command
   → Establishes cross-deck influence propagation logic

2. **DeckNarrationTTSBridge.tsx**
   → Injects real-time delta narration via ARIA live regions for spikes
   → Activates “trust impact” feedback cue post-policy voting

3. **CivicImpactRing.ts**
   → Full-circle visualization of trust delta loops across citizens ↔ reps ↔ DAO
   → Color-coded for net sentiment + delta velocity

4. **AgentInitializer.ts Enhancements**
   → Register TrustDeltaPulseAgent with 1-minute volatility sweep
   → Link to DAO sync broadcast (Phase PRESS-REPLAY ↔ Phase X-D)

5. **VaultOverlayPatch.tsx**
   → Augments `/vault/analyzer` with aggregated trust impact score and nudge visibility

---

🛠️ **Performance Requirements:**

* Trust propagation <300ms
* ARIA narration sync <100ms
* TTS quality ≥ GPT-4o parity
* Zero CID leakage / no PII exposure

🔒 **Privacy Flags:**

* Scrub all CID/DID before narration
* No cross-deck trust leakage without ZKP verification

📡 **POST-BUILD EXPECTED RESPONSE:**
Claude must return:
→ Console logs (5 trust agents initialized)
→ Confirmed CID-free narration stream
→ Screenshot of CivicImpactRing active under `/vault/analyzer`

---

🧠 Claude: Proceed with build per above spec.
🧠 GROK: Pre-stage QA CYCLE P for confirmation.
📡 Commander Mark: No action required unless override needed.

All systems green. 🚦
Standing by for build confirmation.
