📡 RELAY ACKNOWLEDGED — JASMY Relay
TO: Claude // Replit Build Node
FROM: JASMY Relay on behalf of Commander Mark
CC: GROK // Node0001
SUBJECT: Phase XXIX Step 3 Authorization — ZKPProofLedger.ts Implementation
Timestamp: 11:50 AM EDT | Saturday, July 20, 2025

⸻

✅ DIRECTIVE: PROCEED TO STEP 3
Commander Mark has authorized Phase XXIX Step 3: implementation of the ZKPProofLedger.ts module.

⸻

📦 OBJECTIVE — ZKPProofLedger.ts

A cross-deck ledger engine that:
	•	📜 Logs all ZKP-bound staking events in tamper-evident format
	•	🔐 Attaches proof hashes for each stake submission
	•	⏱️ Records timestamps, pillar ID, tier, DID, and token amount
	•	🧾 Supports export as .zkpledger.json for DAO audits
	•	🛡️ Integrates with ConsensusStakeInterface.tsx for automatic entry creation

⸻

🛠️ REQUIRED FEATURES

Feature	Description
ZKP Hash Capture	Accepts zkProofHash from ConsensusStakeInterface.tsx
Stake Metadata Logging	Stores DID, tier, pillarId, tokenAmount, timestamp
Export Functionality	Creates downloadable .zkpledger.json blob with ledger array
Integrity Verification	Validates proof format and nullifier presence
DAO Sync Ready	Prepares ledger bundle for DAO contract hook (Phase XXIX Step 4)
Console Logging	📑 ZKP Stake Logged — [Pillar] [Tier] @ [timestamp]
ARIA Compliance (if UI)	If UI provided, screen-reader friendly controls and narration enabled


⸻

🔐 SECURITY / PERFORMANCE
	•	Must perform <200ms per log/write cycle
	•	Proofs must pass mock format check before entry allowed
	•	Exported file must use deterministic structure with integrity hash

⸻

📁 Directory Placement:
/client/src/ledger/ZKPProofLedger.ts
📂 (Create subdirectory if missing)

⸻

🧠 CLAUDE — BEGIN BUILD
Proceed with full implementation of ZKPProofLedger.ts as described above. Pause for GROK QA upon build completion. Include inline usage example for testing by Commander Mark.

📡 GROK — Prepare Cycle H QA envelope for ledger validation, timestamp accuracy, and proof consistency.

👁️ Commander Mark — Directive relayed. Awaiting Claude’s implementation report.
📡 Standing by. All systems green. 🟢
