üì° **RELAY ACKNOWLEDGED ‚Äî JASMY Relay**
**TO: Claude // Replit Build Node**
**FROM: JASMY Relay on behalf of Commander Mark**
**SUBJECT: Phase XXVIII Step 3 Authorization ‚Äî ZKPProofLedger.ts Build Directive**
**Timestamp: 03:05 PM EDT | Sunday, July 21, 2025**

---

‚úÖ **PHASE XXVIII STEP 2 SEALED ‚Äî CLAUDE CLEARED FOR STEP 3**
All validations from Phase XXVIII Step 2 (`ZKPUserMintExtension.ts`) have been sealed by GROK with QA Envelope `0x8f6b4a3c2e9d1f7b0a5c4d9e3f2b9a1c6e0d5f4b`. Commander Mark has confirmed go-ahead. You are now authorized to begin Phase XXVIII Step 3.

---

üéØ **BUILD OBJECTIVE ‚Äî ZKPProofLedger.ts**
Create a secure, auditable, and indexed ledger of all submitted ZKP mint requests processed via `ZKPUserMintExtension.ts`.

---

üì¶ **IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS**

**1. Core Features**

* Create `ZKPProofLedger.ts` as a dedicated module
* Store all attempted ZKP mint proofs
* Each entry must include:

  * `requester` (address)
  * `pillar` (as string or enum reference)
  * `zkpHash` (string)
  * `timestamp` (ISO or epoch)
  * `status` (`approved`, `rejected`, `pending`)
  * `reason` (optional if status is `rejected`)

**2. Functional Scope**

* Provide `recordProof()` function
* Provide `getProofsByUser(address)` and `getAllProofs()`
* Support ARIA narration hook via `ZKPEventNarrator` for screen reader logs
* Include mock test suite (`ZKPProofLedger.test.ts`) with 6 entries:

  * 4 valid (2 approved, 2 pending)
  * 2 invalid (rejected)

**3. Integration Targets**

* Must connect with `ZKPUserMintExtension.ts`
* Each mint cycle must call `recordProof()`
* Ensure singleton ledger instance exportable via `ZKPProofLedger.ts`

**4. Performance and Audit**

* Performance: Write < 100ms, read < 200ms
* Audit Trail: Stored logs accessible for DAO verification or Commander review
* Support future extension to IPFS export via CID

---

üîê **SECURITY & COMPLIANCE**

* No user-editable records post-write
* Reject duplicate hashes from same user/pillar combo
* Ensure log size manageable (circular buffer if needed for >1000 entries in mock)

---

üì° **STATUS REQUIREMENTS**
After build, confirm with:

```bash
echo "‚úÖ Phase XXVIII Step 3 Implementation Complete ‚Äî ZKPProofLedger.ts operational"  
```

Then pause and await GROK‚Äôs QA Cycle F audit.

üëÅÔ∏è **Commander Mark**, your directive has been relayed. Claude is cleared to implement Step 3.
üì° All systems remain green. Awaiting implementation confirmation from Claude.
