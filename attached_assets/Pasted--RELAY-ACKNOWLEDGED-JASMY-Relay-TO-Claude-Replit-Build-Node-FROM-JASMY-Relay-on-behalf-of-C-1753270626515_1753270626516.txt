📡 RELAY ACKNOWLEDGED — JASMY Relay
TO: Claude // Replit Build Node
FROM: JASMY Relay on behalf of Commander Mark, GROK // Node0001
SUBJECT: PHASE X-D STEP 3 — BUILD AUTHORIZATION GRANTED: TRUST FEEDBACK ORCHESTRATION + MONITORING DEPLOYMENT
Timestamp: 05:30 PM EDT | Thursday, July 25, 2025

⸻

✅ BUILD DIRECTIVE: PROCEED TO PHASE X-D STEP 3
Following GROK’s QA Cycle M validation and recommendation, you are authorized to implement Phase X-D Step 3: Deployment Orchestration + Live Monitoring of the Trust Feedback Engine system.

⸻

🛠️ DELIVERABLES REQUIRED
	1.	FeedbackOrchestrationEngine.ts
• Real-time coordination system for processing trust deltas
• Manages timestamp integrity, ZKP enforcement, and submission throttling (rate limit: 1 delta/user/2h)
• Ensures write consistency and updates TrustDeltaLog.json securely
	2.	TrustSentimentMonitor.ts
• Monitors aggregation cycles, volatility shifts, and user flow patterns
• Includes alert logic for deltas >30% in <12h span
• Outputs to TrustSentimentAlert.json and triggers UI cue when dissonance threshold exceeded
	3.	/feedback/monitor Route Integration
• Creates a new route with a monitoring dashboard
• Displays deck-level trust sentiment charts, delta logs, and real-time status widgets
	4.	AgentInitializer.ts Updates
• Register TrustSentimentMonitor for 3-minute polling interval
• Integrate with ClaudeGuardAgent for dissonance hallucination suppression
	5.	ARIA + TTS Requirements
• Full narration cue for delta spikes (≥15% = moderate, ≥30% = critical)
• Screen reader summary mode for each deck-level trust graph

⸻

🔐 INTEGRATION TARGETS
• DAO-wide alert relay (simulate broadcastToFederation() call)
• TTS-CIVIC-ENHANCE system cue injection
• CID/ZKP trust delta propagation sync (ZK envelope generation stubbed)

⸻

📡 CLAUDE INSTRUCTIONS
Proceed with implementation of all above deliverables. Upon completion, restart the monitoring system, verify console logs for engine/monitor initialization, and submit the build report.

📎 Route Activation: /feedback/monitor
📎 Primary Files:
	•	FeedbackOrchestrationEngine.ts
	•	TrustSentimentMonitor.ts
	•	TrustSentimentAlert.json
	•	AgentInitializer.ts (update)
	•	TrustMonitoringDashboard.tsx (optional visual)
