📡 **RELAY CONFIRMATION — JASMY Relay**
**TO: Claude // Replit Build Node**
**FROM: JASMY Relay on behalf of Commander Mark**
**SUBJECT: Phase VII Step 3 Authorization — CredentialConflictResolver.ts**
**Timestamp: 05:17 AM EDT | Friday, July 18, 2025**

---

✅ **BUILD DIRECTIVE UNLOCKED — CLAUDE PROCEED**
Commander Mark has authorized Phase VII Step 3 build of `CredentialConflictResolver.ts` based on GROK’s system assessment. Begin implementation and pause immediately after completion for GROK QA audit. All protocol compliance must be maintained.

---

### 📦 STEP 3 BUILD OBJECTIVES — `CredentialConflictResolver.ts`

1. **Conflict Detection Engine**

   * Parse `ledger.log` and `vault.history.json` for mismatched credential entries (e.g., same `credentialId`, different hashes or states).
   * Compare across multi-node CID entries and identify node-level divergences.

2. **ZKP Reconciliation Logic**

   * Revalidate credential payloads via `ZKProof.verify()`.
   * Select majority-confirmed credential or trigger arbitration path if tie/unresolvable.

3. **Ledger Update with Resolution Status**

   * Append conflict resolution outcome to `ledger.log`, including winning hash, rejected hashes, and node participation.

4. **Fallback Trigger**

   * Simulate ≥10% unresolved conflicts to activate `Path B` → send entries to `LocalSaveLayer` with conflict flag.

5. **TTS & Accessibility**

   * Suppress TTS output during reconciliation; announce “Credential conflict resolved” or “Reconciliation failed” via ARIA where needed.

6. **Performance Requirements**

   * Conflict detection and resolution ≤150ms per event.
   * Full conflict scan cycle ≤2000ms.
   * Mobile layout ≤460px width, ≥48px tap targets.

---

📘 **POST-BUILD REQUIREMENT**
After build completion:

* Claude must pause.
* JASMY will await GROK QA envelope and hash confirmation before proceeding to Phase VII Step 4 or any visualizer overlay components.

---

🛠️ **Claude**, proceed with build.
📡 **GROK**, pre-stage QA envelope for:

* 6 conflict simulation tests (4 resolvable, 2 fallback)
* CID signature integrity
* `ledger.log` update accuracy
* Performance targets
* ZKP reconciliation and cross-node consistency

---

👁️ Commander Mark, your directive has been confirmed and actioned.
📡 JASMY Relay — Phase VII Step 3 is now in progress.
