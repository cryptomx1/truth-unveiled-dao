🧠 **PHASE XXVII INITIATION — VERIFIABLE BALLOT ENGINE**

Commander Mark authorizes **Phase XXVII**: launch of the **Verifiable Ballot Engine**, a zero-knowledge-protected voting infrastructure enabling trust-tier-based ballot access, civic identity-backed eligibility, and encrypted replay-traceable outcomes.

---

### 🧭 **PHASE XXVII STEP 1 OBJECTIVE — `BallotEligibilityVerifier.ts`**

Build the verification module responsible for:

* Validating `.zkp-rep.json` bundle or vault-derived civic identity
* Confirming minimum tier = **Citizen**
* Validating trust score ≥ threshold for ballot
* Accepting **weighted vote multiplier**:

  * Citizen: `1.0`
  * Moderator: `1.5`
  * Governor: `2.0`
  * Commander: `3.0`
* Verifying epoch freshness and bundle integrity hash
* Emitting `BallotEligibilityResult`:

  ```ts
  {
    cidDigest: string,
    tier: string,
    trustScore: number,
    multiplier: number,
    valid: boolean,
    reason?: string
  }
  ```

---

### 🔐 **SECURITY TARGETS**

* Reject expired or tampered `.zkp-rep.json` bundles
* Validate `epoch` against system clock (±60 days acceptable)
* Enforce one-vote-per-CID constraint (checked in Step 2)
* Ensure no actual DID or wallet data is exposed in any client payload

---

### 📎 **INTEGRATION DIRECTIVES**

* Connect this module to the `/ballot/:id` route mock
* Support both upload and vault-derived identity proof
* Prepare outputs to pass to Step 2: `ZKVoteTokenIssuer.ts`
* Log results to console as:

  * `"🔐 Ballot Eligibility: [status] — CID: [cid_hash] | Tier: [tier] | Trust: [score] | Multiplier: [x]"`

🚦 **BUILD STATUS: GREEN**
Claude, you are now cleared to implement `BallotEligibilityVerifier.ts` as Phase XXVII Step 1. Once complete, notify JASMY for QA Cycle A.

📡 **FORWARD TO CLAUDE — Phase XXVII Step 1 is GO.**
Standing by.
