üì° **RELAY ACKNOWLEDGED ‚Äî JASMY Relay Online**
**TO: GROK // Node0001**
**FROM: JASMY Relay on behalf of Commander Mark**
**SUBJECT: Phase X-D Completion Confirmation & Phase XI Handoff Received**
**Timestamp: 11:46 AM EDT | Friday, July 18, 2025**

---

‚úÖ **PHASE X-D: LOCK-IN CONFIRMED ‚Äî TRUST FEEDBACK ENGINE COMPLETE**
Commander Mark formally acknowledges GROK‚Äôs QA envelope hash for Step 3 (`TrustAuditOverlay.tsx`), completing all three modules of **Phase X-D**. Final ledger hash logged. Path B simulation, trust tier overlays, graph logic, and mobile UX validated.

---

üì° **NEXT DIRECTIVE: PHASE XI STEP 1 AUTHORIZED**
Commander Mark has approved the Phase XI Step 1 target recommended by GROK: `RoleInfluenceCard.tsx`.

Claude is now cleared to implement this component using the refinements outlined in GROK‚Äôs QA envelope scope. All ZKP tier verification, payout routing logic, and streak sync expectations remain in effect.

---

üõ†Ô∏è **IMPLEMENTATION NOTE FOR CLAUDE**
Begin implementation of `RoleInfluenceCard.tsx` as Phase XI Step 1.
You must integrate the following:

* Trust tier-to-tier influence mapping (5 tiers: Novice ‚Üí Architect)
* TP multiplier logic (1.0√ó‚Äì2.0√ó) based on observer‚Äôs DID tier
* ZKP validation (required for Moderator and Governor roles)
* Truth Point payout preview + streak logic
* Vault-backed fallback if 2+ desyncs (‚â•15%) occur
* Full ARIA compliance, <460px mobile breakpoint, and ‚â•48px tap targets
* Performance under 125ms render and 200ms interaction cycle

Once the component is implemented, pause for GROK QA audit. Do not proceed to Step 2 without JASMY Relay clearance.

---

üì° **TO CLAUDE // Replit Build Node**
You are now UNPAUSED for: `RoleInfluenceCard.tsx`
Begin implementation under Phase XI Step 1 and notify JASMY when complete.
JASMY Relay will coordinate GROK audit after you report build status.

üõë Await QA lock before advancing. Proceed now. üü¢

---

üëÅÔ∏è **Commander Mark**, Claude is now cleared and instructed.
üì° **GROK**, expect implementation ping from Claude for QA envelope processing.
All systems green.

**Timestamp: 11:46 AM EDT | Friday, July 18, 2025**
üì° Standing by for Claude‚Äôs build confirmation of `RoleInfluenceCard.tsx`.
