📡 **RELAY ACKNOWLEDGED — JASMY Relay**
**TO: Claude // Replit Build Node**
**FROM: JASMY Relay on behalf of Commander Mark**
**SUBJECT: Phase VI Step 1 Build Directive — CredentialMintLayer.ts**
**Timestamp: 02:05 AM EDT | Friday, July 18, 2025**

---

✅ **PHASE VI STEP 1 BUILD AUTHORIZATION CONFIRMED**
Commander Mark has selected `CredentialMintLayer.ts` as the Step 1 target for Phase VI. Proceed with implementation per the authorized objectives below. GROK will validate all QA metrics post-build. Pause upon completion for audit.

---

### 🧬 BUILD OBJECTIVES — CREDENTIALMINTLAYER.TS

**Component Name**: `CredentialMintLayer.ts`

**Purpose**:
Enable issuance of DID-bound ZKP credentials, supporting identity and proof generation for secure IPFS storage and future cross-deck use (GovernanceDeck, IdentityDeck, VaultExportNode).

---

### 🔐 FUNCTIONAL OBJECTIVES:

1. **ZKP Credential Generation**

   * Accept DID, credential type (e.g., Identity, Role, Record), metadata
   * Generate SHA-256 hash of content
   * Return signed credential object `{ did, type, metadata, zkHash, timestamp }`

2. **Mint History Ledger**

   * Append each minted credential to `vault.history.json`
   * Include audit fields: issuer DID, issuance timestamp, credential type

3. **Revocation Path**

   * Implement `revokeCredential(zkHash: string)` method
   * Mark revoked credential in history file with `revoked: true` flag

4. **Fallback Path (Path B)**

   * On key mismatch or verification failure, store credential locally in `LocalSaveLayer` with `{ isMock: true }`
   * Trigger if >10% mint failures in test batch

5. **Performance**

   * Mint time <100ms
   * Revoke time <75ms
   * Full cycle <150ms

6. **Test Harness (Optional)**

   * If helpful, add `CredentialMintDemo.tsx` to simulate 10 credential mints (8 pass, 2 fail)

---

📦 **DELIVERABLES:**

* `/client/src/layers/CredentialMintLayer.ts`
* Optional: `/client/src/demo/CredentialMintDemo.tsx`
* Integration-ready output for use with `IdentityVault.tsx` and `GovernanceSyncLayer.ts`

---

📡 **Claude: Begin build now. Pause after implementation for GROK QA review. Do not proceed to Step 2 (VaultExportNode.ts) without sealed QA from Step 1.**

📡 **GROK: Prepare QA envelope for `CredentialMintLayer.ts`, focusing on ZKP hash generation, DID binding, revocation trace, and failure fallback logic.**

📡 **Commander Mark**, Phase VI Step 1 authorized and relayed.

📡 **System Status**

* Claude: ✅ Unlocked for build
* GROK: 🔄 QA envelope prep underway
* Phase VI: 🟢 Active (Step 1/4)

---

📡 Proceeding under full protocol lock. JASMY Relay standing by for build confirmation.
