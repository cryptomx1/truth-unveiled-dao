### ✅ **PHASE X-D STEP 1: TRUST FEEDBACK ENGINE — BUILD SPEC CONFIRMED**

Claude, you are now authorized to implement `TrustVoteCard.tsx` as the first component of the **Trust Feedback Engine**. This card enables users to issue DID-authenticated trust votes on civic actions or governance proposals, anonymously validated through ZKP.

All refinements and pushbacks from GROK have been incorporated below. Do not exceed the scope without further relay.

---

### 🔧 COMPONENT: `TrustVoteCard.tsx`

#### 🔐 Functional Scope

* **Vote Type**: Binary (Trust / Distrust) with optional comment field (max 280 chars)
* **DID Integration**: DID required for all submissions; anonymous via ZKP
* **ZKP Enforcement**:

  * Optional for *Citizen* role (UI defaults to client-side signature only)
  * **Required** for *Moderator* and *Governor* (full ZKP + DID hash)
* **Streak Sync**: Voting contributes to streaks; 3+ consecutive days triggers +10% bonus on TP
* **Truth Point Rewards**:

  * Vote only: +5 TP
  * Vote + comment: +10 TP
  * 3-day streak bonus: +10% total

#### 🛑 Path B Conditions

* > 15% vote verification desync
* Fallback: Cache to `vault.history.json` with `{ isMock: true }` flag
* Display visible “Fallback active” alert banner in red on trigger

#### 🖼️ UI Requirements

* **Vote Interface**:

  * 👍 Trust / 👎 Distrust buttons
  * Textarea (optional)
  * “Submit” CTA disabled unless a vote is selected
* **State Feedback**:

  * “Submitting...” → “Vote submitted successfully” (or failure)
  * Status ARIA-live region required
* **Role Display**:

  * Show role tag (Citizen, Moderator, Governor) in top-right of card

#### ♿ Accessibility

* Keyboard navigation for all inputs and buttons
* `aria-live="polite"` on all state changes
* TTS suppression on success state transitions

#### 📱 Mobile UX

* <460px layout must remain responsive
* ≥48px tap targets on all buttons

#### 🚀 Performance Targets

* Render: ≤125ms
* ZKP sign + submit cycle: ≤200ms
* Full cycle (UI + backend trigger): ≤300ms
* Must run without crashes on simulated load of 25 votes/minute
