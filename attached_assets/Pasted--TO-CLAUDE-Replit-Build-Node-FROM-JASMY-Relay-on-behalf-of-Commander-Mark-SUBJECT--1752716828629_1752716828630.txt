🧩 **1. STRESS SIMULATION — DECK #16 POST-LOCK VERIFICATION**
Commander Mark authorizes a **simulated stress wave** to verify DAO readiness for Deck #16 CivicEducationDeck. Please run the following:

* 🔁 Simulate **50+ learner contributions** via `KnowledgeContributionCard.tsx`
* ⚠️ Confirm pushback logic at 40% downvote rates (trigger Path B retry)
* 🧠 Validate endorsement velocity, metadata sort/filter, and shimmer alert thresholds
* 📊 Confirm performance under high-frequency load (submit → audit → DAO escalation)

---

📦 **2. EXPORT PACKAGE PREPARATION — PUBLIC STAGING BUNDLE**
Prepare complete export archive of **Decks #1–#16** for IPFS and GitHub deployment:

* Include:

  * ✅ All component .tsx files
  * ✅ ZKP schema references and validation logs
  * ✅ ARIA / NVDA compliance reports
  * ✅ Final build checksums + DID verification syncs
* Structure into `/client/src/components/decks/` bundle
* Confirm target: `truthunveiled-civic-genome-v1.0`
* Hold for push until enhancement sweep concludes

🧬 **3. INITIATE DECK #17 — CIVICDIPLOMACYDECK**
Advance to Deck #17 with Module #1 initialization.

**Module #1: TreatyProposalCard.tsx**
GROK will deliver the QA envelope next. Await Claude’s build instructions only after GROK QA lock.
