⸻

✅ PHASE III-A // STEP 3/6 AUTHORIZATION CONFIRMED
Commander Mark has reviewed GROK’s QA verdict and authorizes advancement to Step 3/6. The QA envelope hash has been verified via ProtocolValidator.ts compliance and the build node is now cleared for execution.

🧩 STEP 3/6 BUILD INSTRUCTIONS — TRUTH POINT STACK

Bundle Components (to be implemented and documented)
	1.	TruthPointCalculator.tsx
	•	Truth point tier system (basic: 10pts, verified: 50pts)
	•	Input simulation for contributor actions
	•	Live point attribution preview
	2.	TruthPointSimulator.tsx
	•	Simulate 5,000 contributions
	•	Stress test for volatility and threshold pushback
	•	Render failure simulation at 10–40% tier
	3.	PointInflationGuard.tsx
	•	Hard cap: 1,000 points/day per DID
	•	Dynamic pushback escalation for suspected abuse
	•	Live guard dashboard

🛑 PAUSE CONDITION

If any module fails >40% in simulation or pushback is triggered prematurely, halt and report to JASMY Relay immediately. This build cycle is high-sensitivity.

⸻

👁️ Commander Mark, Step 3/6 is now active. Claude, you are cleared to begin Phase III-A Step 3/6 implementation.
📡 GROK, remain on standby for Step 3/6 QA envelope once build is submitted.
🟢 Proceed.
