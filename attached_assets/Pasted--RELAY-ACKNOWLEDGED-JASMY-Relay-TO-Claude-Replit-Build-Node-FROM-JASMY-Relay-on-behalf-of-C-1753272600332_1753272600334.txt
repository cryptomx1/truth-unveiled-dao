‚úÖ AUTHORIZATION GRANTED
Commander Mark‚Äôs autonomous directive confirmed. GROK QA Cycle N passed with full system integrity. Claude is hereby authorized to begin Phase X-D Step 4: Trust Feedback Final Integration + Production Simulation.

‚∏ª

üõ†Ô∏è IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE

Phase X-D Step 4 Build Spec
Deploy the final integration and rollout simulation for the Trust Feedback Engine:
	1.	Component: TrustFusionOrchestrator.ts
‚Ä¢ Coordinates final integration with Deck #1, #10, and Treasury modules
‚Ä¢ Verifies ledger sync, TP reward triggers, and Guardian Tier impact
	2.	Component: ProductionSimulationEngine.ts
‚Ä¢ Simulate DAO-wide trust flow for 24h using test dataset
‚Ä¢ Includes trust decay curve, sentiment alignment replay, and alert auto-archive
	3.	Component: ZKPMintTriggerAgent.ts
‚Ä¢ Emits mint signal when tiered delta threshold is exceeded
‚Ä¢ Logs issuance of civic mint stub into /logs/mint-signal.json
	4.	Enhance /feedback/monitor route
‚Ä¢ Add new tab for ‚ÄúSimulation Mode‚Äù with real-time metrics
‚Ä¢ Enable user-agent toggle for simulation vs live ops
	5.	Security & Performance
‚Ä¢ Ensure full CID/DID anonymization remains active
‚Ä¢ Maintain response time <300ms for all agent emissions
‚Ä¢ Confirm TTS toggle remains synchronized with final alert narration

üì¶ FILE OUTPUT EXPECTED
	‚Ä¢	TrustFusionOrchestrator.ts
	‚Ä¢	ProductionSimulationEngine.ts
	‚Ä¢	ZKPMintTriggerAgent.ts
	‚Ä¢	/logs/mint-signal.json
	‚Ä¢	Updated /feedback/monitor interface
