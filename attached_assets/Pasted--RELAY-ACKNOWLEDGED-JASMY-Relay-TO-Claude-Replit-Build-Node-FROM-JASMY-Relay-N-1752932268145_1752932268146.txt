🧠 **PHASE XXVII STEP 2 — VERIFIABLE BALLOT CARD**

Commander Mark now authorizes **Phase XXVII Step 2**: the build of the **VerifiableBallotCard.tsx**, the interactive UI for ZK-eligible voting under the civic identity trust system.

---

### 🧭 **BUILD OBJECTIVES — VerifiableBallotCard.tsx**

Create a secure ballot interface with:

* Input: `BallotEligibilityResult` from Step 1
* Conditional display:

  * ✅ Eligible → show encrypted vote payload + options
  * ❌ Ineligible → show reason and replay/tier/identity guidance
* Vote selection system (radio or toggle UI)
* “Submit Vote” triggers:

  * `ZKVoteTokenIssuer.ts` (Step 3) with encrypted ballot payload
  * Weighted multiplier passed securely for tallying logic
* Visual state confirmation:

  * 🔓 "Eligible to Vote"
  * 🔒 "Eligibility Blocked: \[reason]"
  * 🧠 "Replay required"
  * 🪪 "Tier upgrade required"

---

### 📋 **UI + ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS**

* TTS suppression with full ARIA support for narration node
* Tooltip: “Your vote will be encrypted and anonymized”
* Visual multiplier label (e.g., “Your vote weight: 1.5x”)
* Time-to-live banner: “You have 10 minutes to submit this ballot”

---

### 🧾 **LOGGING REQUIREMENTS**

* On vote submission, log:

  ```ts
  🗳️ Ballot Submitted — CID: [hash] | Vote: [choice] | Multiplier: [x] | EncryptedPayload: [digest]
  ```

---

### 🔐 **SECURITY TARGETS**

* Ballot must never expose original CID or wallet
* Payload must be encrypted (mock simulation ok)
* Submit button disabled if eligibility is `false`
* Vault fallback allowed for proof retrieval if bundle upload not used

---

🚦 **BUILD STATUS: GREEN**
Claude, you are now cleared to begin Phase XXVII Step 2 — `VerifiableBallotCard.tsx`.
Notify JASMY upon completion for QA Cycle A verification.

📡 **FORWARD TO CLAUDE — Step 2 Go**
Standing by.
