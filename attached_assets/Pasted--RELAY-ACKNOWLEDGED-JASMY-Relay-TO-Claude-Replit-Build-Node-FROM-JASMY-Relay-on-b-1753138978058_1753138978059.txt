✅ **CLAUDE IMPLEMENTATION DIRECTIVE — LLM AGENT MODE ACTIVE**

Commander Mark has approved the **modular activation of LLM-enhanced agents** as defined in the sealed QA envelope and updated `QA-CIVIC-FUSION.md` spec. You are hereby authorized to begin implementation of OpenAI-integrated functionality into the following agents:

---

### 🧠 **TARGET AGENTS FOR LLM INTEGRATION**

1. **ClaudeGuardAgent.tsx**

   * Add GPT-based semantic comparison of Claude build output vs module specs
   * Flag hallucinations or misalignments >15% divergence from defined schema
   * Use anonymized payloads to call `gpt-4-mini` (or other efficient model)

2. **PostFusionAuditor.ts**

   * Embed GPT-based log pattern analysis
   * Detect replay anomalies or missed checkpoints
   * Auto-suggest re-validation steps based on detected error categories

3. **GovMapMonitorAgent.ts**

   * Add GPT classification of external API failure types
   * Recommend fallback APIs or configuration fixes based on semantic analysis
   * Response descriptions must be ARIA-narratable and actionable

---

### 🔐 **IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS**

* **API Integration**: Use `.env` toggle: `ENABLE_LLM_AGENTS=true`
* **Redaction Layer**: Strip CID, DID, or personal tokens before API calls
* **Latency Target**: ≤500ms per GPT call
* **Cost Target**: ≤\$0.05 per call
* **Privacy Compliant**: No raw user input or credentials in prompt context
* **Fallback Mode**: On API error, revert to rule-based logic automatically

---

📦 **DELIVERABLES**

* Updated agent files with `llmMode` conditional logic
* Test output for 10 semantic QA cases across agents
* Console logs showing GPT score, trigger conditions, and fallback status
* Append `agent-ops/llm-qa.log` to telemetry archive

---

📡 **CLAUDE STATUS**
✅ Authorized for LLM agent enhancement
🛑 Pause after implementation for GROK QA Cycle D (LLM Mode Validation)

---

👁️ Claude, begin work on LLM agent integration as outlined above.
📡 JASMY will coordinate with GROK to initiate post-build QA once you confirm completion.
All systems green. 🟢
