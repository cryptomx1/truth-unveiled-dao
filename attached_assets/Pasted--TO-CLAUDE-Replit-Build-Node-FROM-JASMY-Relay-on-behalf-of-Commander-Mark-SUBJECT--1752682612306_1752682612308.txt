✅ **BUILD DIRECTIVE: MODULE #2 — CIVICENGAGEMENTDECK**

Claude, you are now authorized to build the following module under Deck #11:

> 📦 `client/src/components/decks/CivicEngagementDeck/TrustStreakRewardCard.tsx`
> 🎯 Purpose: Visualize reward tiers based on ZKP-validated trust streaks
> 🎮 Features: Animated reward ladder, real-time tier unlocks, ZKP sync from Decks #6–#9, pulse icons, and tier-specific TTS

---

### 📋 BUILD SPECIFICATIONS (FROM QA ENVELOPE)

1. **Gamified Reward Ladder**

   * Tiers: 3-day (Bronze), 7-day (Silver), 14-day (Gold)
   * Real-time streak verification, color-coded progress
   * Confetti or celebratory animation on unlocks
   * Layout: `flex-col`, `max-w-sm`, `gap-3`, dark mode palette

2. **Visual/Audio Feedback**

   * Status ring: `ring-green-500` for verified tiers
   * Icons: `i-fa-award`, `i-fa-star` or `i-fa-shield-alt` (tier-dependent)
   * TTS on unlock: “New reward unlocked: Gold tier” (use Web Speech API, no overlap)
   * Aria region: `aria-live="polite"`, `role="region"`

3. **Performance Constraints**

   * Render <125ms
   * Sync (ZKP match) <100ms
   * Full cycle (render + sync + TTS) <200ms
   * Mobile UX: Stable under 460px, tap targets ≥48px

4. **Pushback Trigger**

   * If >10% mismatch during tier validation: set `isPushbackActive = true`
   * Else: continue normal tier progression

5. **Mock Implementation Notes**

   * Use simulated referral logs from Deck #6/9 to simulate streaks
   * Default unlocked: 3-day tier
   * Default pending: 7-day (90% progress), 14-day (locked)

### 🧪 QA ALIGNMENT

Your build will be validated by GROK against QA Envelope timestamped 05:04 AM EDT.
Do not proceed to Module #3. Pause after completion and report back with:

* ✅ Build confirmation
* 📊 Performance metrics (render, sync, cycle)
* 🎨 Visual snapshot: ring display + reward ladder
* 🔊 TTS behavior: mount + unlock
* 🧪 Pushback status: mismatch rate %

👁️ Commander Mark is observing.
🧠 GROK is on standby for audit.
🟢 Proceed, Claude. Awaiting your completion report for `TrustStreakRewardCard.tsx`.
