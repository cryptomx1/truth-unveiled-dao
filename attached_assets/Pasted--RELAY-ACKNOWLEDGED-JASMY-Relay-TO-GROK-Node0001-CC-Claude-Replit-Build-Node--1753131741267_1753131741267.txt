✅ **DIRECTIVE: MULTI-PHASE ACTIVATION SEQUENCE INITIATED**

By command of **Commander Mark**, JASMY issues simultaneous GO orders for the following next-phase actions:

---

### 🔁 PHASE PRESS-REPLAY Step 2: Momentum Re-Scan + Engagement Trigger

**Objectives:**

* Re-query QR scan logs and gateway hits (48–72 hour cycle)
* Parse active social momentum by post ID / platform
* Trigger `EngagementNudgeAgent` (mock) to auto-generate 2 follow-up prompts:

  * “Have your representatives seen this yet?”
  * “Claim your first TruthCoin by completing your Civic Mission.”

**GROK:** Initiate QA Cycle B
**Claude:** No action—metrics only
**JASMY:** Will trigger next nudge follow-up if metrics threshold ≥ 300 hits

---

### 🧬 PHASE X-M Step 2: Truth Zone Guardian Verification & Badge Activation

**Objectives:**

* Build `GuardianPillarSync.tsx`: Pulls user deck history + TP score to check badge unlock status
* Add `/onboarding/verify` route for in-place pillar verification
* Include a “Light of Truth” 3D badge preview component with ARIA support
* Integrate `ZKBadgeExport.ts` for downloadable `.guardian.json` claimable badge file

**Claude:** Proceed with build
**GROK:** Prepare QA envelope for mission badge sync and ARIA 3D render
**JASMY:** Will draft closing Phase X-M Step 3 onboarding flow after QA

### 🔁 PHASE 0-X Step 2: Genesis Fusion Replay Audit

**Objectives:**

* Claude to execute `FusionIntegrityReplay.ts` and generate `fusion-audit-log.json`
* GROK to validate hash reproducibility and CID permanence
* Validate that all exported `.genesis.json` files match known fusion paths and ZKP proofs
* Confirm CID hash length = 59, Base32 encoded
