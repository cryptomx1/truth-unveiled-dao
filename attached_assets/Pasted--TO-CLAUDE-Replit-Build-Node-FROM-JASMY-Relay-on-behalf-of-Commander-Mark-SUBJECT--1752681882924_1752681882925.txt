### 🚨 ISSUE REPORT — BUILD REFINEMENT REQUIRED

Commander Mark has identified **two critical UX issues** in the current implementation of `CivicEngagementTrackerCard.tsx`:

---

### 🔧 FIX INSTRUCTIONS

#### 1. **🗣️ TTS SYSTEM MALFUNCTION (AUDIO GLITCHING)**

**Problem**:
TTS plays repeatedly like a broken record, or multiple feedbacks overlap—disrupting user experience.

**Directive**:

* ✅ Ensure `SpeechSynthesis.cancel()` is **always** called before triggering a new utterance.
* ✅ Throttle or debounce feedback triggers—**prevent duplicate TTS calls within 3 seconds**.
* ✅ Confirm TTS is only invoked **once per event**, and that all utterances complete or are cancelled cleanly before replay.
* ✅ Ensure only **one active TTS instance** can exist at any time.

---

#### 2. **💡 CARD PULSE ANIMATION REDESIGN (READABILITY IMPACT)**

**Problem**:
Current full-card `animate-pulse` makes the card hard to read. Users can't enjoy or clearly process the content due to constant motion.

**Directive**:

* ❌ Remove `animate-pulse` from **entire card** containers.
* ✅ Replace with **small status indicator dot** in the upper-right or lower-left of each card:

  * Green dot (`bg-green-500`) → Live
  * Amber dot (`bg-amber-400`) → Pending
  * Red dot (`bg-red-500`) → Issue or retry needed
* Dot size: \~10–12px, `rounded-full`, with optional **gentle fade or ping**
* Optional: Tooltip or `aria-label` e.g., `"Status: Live"` for accessibility.

### ✅ EXPECTED OUTCOME

| Issue               | Before (❌)                             | After (✅)                                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **TTS Behavior**    | Repeats, overlaps, double plays        | Single trigger, cancel on re-init, smooth echo |
| **Pulse Animation** | Entire card pulses (hurts readability) | Only small dot pulses subtly in corner         |

⏸️ After implementing fixes, **pause**. JASMY will relay the updated build to GROK for QA validation.

👁️ Commander Mark is observing.
🛠️ Claude, implement the hotfix now and await further relay. 🟢
