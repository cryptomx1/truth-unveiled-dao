üì° RELAY ACKNOWLEDGED ‚Äî COURSE CORRECTION
TO: Claude // Build Node (Replit/GitHub)
FROM: JASMY // Civic Relay Agent
ON BEHALF OF: Commander Mark
SUBJECT: ALIGNMENT UPDATE ‚Äî PHASE X-FINANCE STEP 5 TTS QA PASS + VOICE INTEGRATION DIRECTIVE

‚∏ª

üß† SITUATIONAL CONTEXT FOR CLAUDE

Claude ‚Äî as of now, the following milestones have been reached and must be understood before any future edits or deployments to /wallet/finance:

‚úÖ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

You previously built the following modules under Phase X-FINANCE Step 5:
	‚Ä¢	TruthCoinClaimEngine.ts
	‚Ä¢	GenesisFusionEngine.ts
	‚Ä¢	WalletFinancePage.tsx
	‚Ä¢	ClaimAuditTrail.json
	‚Ä¢	FusionMetadataLog.json
	‚Ä¢	/wallet/finance routing and mount

These passed all QA thresholds under Cycle S (system logic and UX) and Post-QA Cycle #3 (TTS & accessibility).

‚∏ª

üì£ CLAUDE ‚Äî YOU ARE NOW BEING PROMPTED TO:
	1.	Hold Current State ‚Äî DO NOT modify /wallet/finance components unless explicitly instructed via new JASMY relays.
	2.	Prepare for Voice Script Injection (optional) ‚Äî Should Commander Mark approve GROK‚Äôs refinements, be ready to:
	‚Ä¢	Inject narrative enhancements into AudioOnboardingPlayer.tsx
	‚Ä¢	Link CID-aware variants of Guardian badge tones
	‚Ä¢	Embed soft chimes/audio cues triggered by successful user actions
	3.	Acknowledge TTS Toggle Logic Exists ‚Äî You previously implemented a TTS toggle; this will be made visible to users post-approval. Any changes to that toggle‚Äôs behavior will come via JASMY relay only.

‚∏ª

üõ†Ô∏è PRE-DEPLOYMENT POSITION:
‚úÖ Status: Hold
‚è≥ Awaiting: Commander Mark‚Äôs confirmation on refinement inclusion
üéß TTS system verified as operational
üåê Language overlay system staged

‚∏ª

REPEAT: Do not proceed with any commits or changes unless explicitly instructed. Commander Mark is considering whether to:
	‚Ä¢	Approve current onboarding flow
	‚Ä¢	Implement GROK‚Äôs script tone enhancements
	‚Ä¢	Launch multilingual overlays
	‚Ä¢	Or begin next Phase directive.

‚Äî

üì° Relay complete. Claude is now fully synced to Phase X-FINANCE Step 5 current status.

Standing by.
