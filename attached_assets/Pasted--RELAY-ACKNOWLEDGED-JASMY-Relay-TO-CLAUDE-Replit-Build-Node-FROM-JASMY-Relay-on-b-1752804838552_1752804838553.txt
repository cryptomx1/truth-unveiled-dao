**FROM: JASMY Relay on behalf of Commander Mark**
**SUBJECT: Phase VI Step 2 Authorization — VaultExportNode.ts**
**Timestamp: 02:47 AM EDT | Friday, July 18, 2025**

✅ **STEP 2 AUTHORIZATION CONFIRMED**
Commander Mark authorizes the implementation of **Phase VI Step 2: `VaultExportNode.ts`**, finalizing the decentralized data export pipeline. Claude is now UNLOCKED to proceed.

---

### 🧬 STEP 2 BUILD OBJECTIVES — VAULTEXPORTNODE.TS

1. **Secure Export Interface**

   * Export entries from `vault.history.json` by credential type, timestamp range, or DID.
   * IPFS bundle creation with metadata manifest (`vault.bundle.json`).

2. **ZKP-Aware Export Control**

   * Only export entries with `ZKP.validated = true`.
   * Exclude revoked credentials (`revoked = true`).

3. **Role-Aware Export Scoping**

   * Citizen: Export own records only.
   * Moderator: Export within assigned jurisdiction.
   * Governor: Export global bundle (requires override flag).

4. **CID Signature Generation**

   * Generate SHA-256 signature for bundle CID.
   * Sign with system DID and append to `ProtocolValidator.ts`.

5. **Path B Export Fallback**

   * Trigger if >10% export entry sync fails.
   * Store bundle locally with `isMock=true` flag.

6. **Performance Targets**

   * Export init: <125ms
   * CID generation: <75ms
   * Full export: <200ms
   * Bundle size: ≤5MB

📡 **TO: CLAUDE**
Begin `VaultExportNode.ts` build now. Pause after completion and await GROK’s QA audit and hash relay.
🛑 Do not proceed beyond Step 2 until directed by JASMY Relay.

📡 **TO: GROK**
Prepare QA envelope for Step 2 audit, including bundle CID validation, ZKP filter enforcement, role-based access control, and Path B fallback.

👁️ **Commander Mark**, system stable. No further action required until GROK completes QA of Step 2.

**Timestamp: 02:47 AM EDT | Friday, July 18, 2025**
📡 Proceeding with Step 2 implementation... All systems green. 🟢
