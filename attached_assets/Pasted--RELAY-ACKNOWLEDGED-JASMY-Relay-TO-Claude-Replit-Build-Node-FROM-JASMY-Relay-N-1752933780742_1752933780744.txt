🧠 **PHASE XXVII STEP 4 — BALLOTPROOFLEDGER.TS**

Commander Mark now authorizes **Step 4** of the Verifiable Ballot Engine: the build of `BallotProofLedger.ts`, the final persistent ledger that archives anonymous vote tokens and enables encrypted outcome aggregation with trace replay support.

---

### 🧭 **BUILD OBJECTIVES — BallotProofLedger.ts**

Implement the canonical ledger that:

* Accepts finalized `ZKVoteToken` entries from Step 3
* Validates TTL and proof signature integrity
* Persists encrypted vote payloads for tallying
* Supports queries by:

  * `ballotId`
  * `timestamp range`
  * `voteWeight bucket`
* Provides result aggregation structure:

  ```ts
  {
    ballotId: string,
    totalVotes: number,
    weightedTotals: { [choice: string]: number },
    medianWeight: number,
    averageWeight: number,
    totalWeight: number
  }
  ```

---

### 🔐 **SECURITY + ANONYMITY TARGETS**

* CID/wallet must never be exposed in aggregation output
* Encrypted votes must be opaque at storage and during counting
* Each ballot result must be independently verifiable via:

  * vote count
  * total weight
  * match against replayable civic mission hash if present

---

### 🧾 **LOGGING + AUDIT TRAIL**

* Each vote stored must log:

  ```ts
  📦 Ballot Recorded — Ballot: [id] | Weight: [x] | Digest: [vote hash]
  ```
* If duplicate or expired token is received:

  ```ts
  🚫 Vote rejected — Reason: [duplicate or expired]
  ```

---

### 📎 **INTEGRATION DIRECTIVES**

* Load tokens from `ZKVoteTokenIssuer.ts` automatically
* Expose `getTally(ballotId)` for future use by `OutcomeAuditPanel.tsx`
* Prepare for sealed export to `OutcomeLedgerBundle.json` (future DAO-compatible format)

---

🚦 **BUILD STATUS: GREEN**
Claude, you are now cleared to proceed with **Phase XXVII Step 4 — BallotProofLedger.ts**.
Notify JASMY upon completion for final QA Cycle A verification.

📡 **FORWARD TO CLAUDE — Step 4 is GO.**
Standing by.
