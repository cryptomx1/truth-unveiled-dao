**SUBJECT: Phase XIII Activation Directive ‚Äî Trust Feedback Engine Initialization**
**Timestamp: 10:04 PM EDT | Friday, July 18, 2025**

---

üß† **PHASE XIII ‚Äî TRUST FEEDBACK ENGINE INITIATION**
Commander Mark authorizes **Phase XIII**: the deployment of the **Trust Feedback Engine**, building on memory, mission, and trace foundations to create **interactive civic trust metrics**, sentiment anchors, and **ZKP-backed validation trails**.

This phase introduces live feedback inputs, streak reinforcement, and decentralized alignment signals via replayable, anonymized memory paths.

---

### üß≠ **PHASE XIII OBJECTIVES**

#### 1. `TrustVoteCard.tsx`

* Allow user to cast feedback (üîº Trust / üîΩ Concern) on any memory or mission
* Integrate ZKP commitment on each vote
* Auto-glow on replayed actions that received feedback

#### 2. `SentimentAggregationCard.tsx`

* Summarize deck-wide trust levels with animated dial
* Toggle between **Constituent View** (user-only) and **Consensus View** (aggregated if quorum met)

#### 3. `FeedbackImpactAnalyzerCard.tsx`

* Display how trust feedback influenced tier upgrades, mission availability, or civic streaks
* Include ARIA narration: ‚ÄúThis trust signal helped unlock‚Ä¶‚Äù

#### 4. `ZKPFeedbackNode.ts`

* Generate anonymized ZKP payload for each feedback vote
* Commit to `feedbackVault.json` for audit trace

#### 5. `FeedbackHistoryPanel.tsx`

* Timeline view of user-submitted feedback
* Tied to CivicMemoryIndex with replayable nodes and causal links

### ‚úÖ **BUILD TARGETS**

| Component                  | Requirements                                       |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| TrustVoteCard              | Vote toggle UI, ZKP embed, memory highlight        |
| SentimentAggregationCard   | Animated dial, toggle view, quorum thresholds      |
| FeedbackImpactAnalyzerCard | Link feedback to state outcomes, ARIA support      |
| ZKPFeedbackNode            | Commit payload with hash, timestamp, anonymized ID |
| FeedbackHistoryPanel       | Interactive, replayable, accessible                |

---

üìé **Integration Notes**

* Decks #1, #3, and #9 must display SentimentAggregationCard (Wallet, Identity, Consensus)
* ZKPProof blobs must align with traceProof and replay state logs
* No step beyond XIII may proceed without GROK audit seal post-build

üö¶ **BUILD STATUS: GREEN**
Claude, you are cleared to initiate **Phase XIII: Trust Feedback Engine** now.
Implement the five modules above in atomic commits and relay completion when ready.

üì° **FORWARD TO CLAUDE** ‚Äî JASMY Relay standing by.
