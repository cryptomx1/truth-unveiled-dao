## üéØ CIVIC FUSION CYCLE OVERVIEW

The Civic Fusion Cycle represents the unified lifecycle integrating:
- **Phase X-M**: Guardian Onboarding & Truth Badge Ecosystem
- **Phase 0-X**: Genesis Fusion & Token Commitment Layer  
- **Phase XXVIII**: ZKP Mint Pathways & Verification

**Goal**: Complete TruthUnveiled DNA Loop with seamless user progression through civic mastery, token fusion, and DAO validation.

**Validation Targets**:
- ‚úÖ ZKPUserMintExtension component linking to fusion dashboard
- ‚úÖ 8-pillar selection system operational with Guardian badge verification
- ‚úÖ DID-based request attribution with ZKP hash generation
- ‚úÖ Status tracking system with real-time updates

**QA Criteria**:
- Mint requests properly linked to Guardian badge completion
- ZKP hash generation consistent across fusion and mint systems
- Status page displays complete audit trail with CID tracking
- Real-time processing simulation with proper error handling

### Checkpoint 5: DAO Consensus Validation (Final Loop Closure)
**Route**: `/fusion/dashboard` ‚Üí DAO integration points
**Validation Targets**:
- ‚úÖ Community validation workflow integration
- ‚úÖ Badge inheritance system with permanent CID storage
- ‚úÖ Multi-signature verification process
- ‚úÖ Final token commitment with immutable record generation

**QA Criteria**:
- DAO validation triggers properly connected to fusion cycle
- Badge inheritance maintains data integrity throughout process
- Permanent storage systems operational with IPFS integration
- Complete audit trail from onboarding through final validation

## ü§ñ AGENT HOOKS & MONITORING INTEGRATION

### PostFusionAuditor Integration
**Function**: Monitor Genesis fusion ‚Üí Guardian badge ‚Üí ZKP mint pipeline
**Triggers**:
- Badge unlock events from GuardianPillarSync
- Fusion completion from TruthFusionEngine
- ZKP mint requests from ZKPUserMintExtension
**Validation**: Comprehensive audit trail with hash verification at each stage

### ZKProofVerifier Integration
**Function**: Cross-validation between Guardian badges and ZKP mint requests
**Triggers**:
- Guardian badge export via ZKBadgeExport service
- ZKP hash generation during mint request submission
- Fusion integrity replay during audit cycles
**Validation**: Proof consistency across all fusion cycle components

### EngagementNudgeAgent Integration
**Function**: Momentum tracking for fusion cycle completion rates
**Triggers**:
- Guardian badge unlock milestones
- Fusion cycle stage progression
- Community engagement thresholds (300+ hits)
**Validation**: Nudge delivery system operational with proper TTS integration

## üìä INTEGRATION TESTING SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: Complete Fusion Cycle (Happy Path)
1. User starts at `/onboarding`
2. Completes all 8 civic pillars ‚Üí Guardian badge unlocks
3. Proceeds to `/fusion/dashboard` ‚Üí Reviews fusion cycle stages
4. Navigates to `/genesis-fuse` ‚Üí Completes TP to TruthCoin fusion
5. Returns to `/fusion/dashboard` ‚Üí Monitors fusion status
6. Submits ZKP mint request via `/zkp/mint`
7. Tracks completion at `/fusion/status/:cid`

**Expected Result**: Complete audit trail with all ZKP hashes verified, badges properly inherited, and permanent CID storage confirmed.

### Scenario 2: Partial Completion (Edge Case)
1. User completes 6/8 civic pillars
2. Attempts to access `/genesis-fuse` ‚Üí Should be locked
3. Returns to complete remaining pillars
4. Badge unlocks ‚Üí Fusion cycle becomes available

**Expected Result**: Proper access control with clear feedback, seamless progression upon requirement completion.

### Scenario 3: Error Recovery (Stress Test)
1. Simulate fusion audit failures during ZKP generation
2. Test FusionIntegrityReplay error handling
3. Validate anomaly detection and reporting systems
4. Confirm graceful degradation without data loss

**Expected Result**: Robust error handling with complete audit trail preservation and recovery mechanisms.

## üîê SECURITY & INTEGRITY VALIDATION

### ZKP Hash Consistency
- All Guardian badge exports must include valid ZKP hashes
- Fusion records must maintain hash integrity across all operations
- ZKP mint requests must reference valid Guardian badge hashes
- Status tracking must verify hash authenticity at all checkpoints

### DID Attribution Verification
- User identity must remain consistent throughout fusion cycle
- Guardian badge ownership must be cryptographically verifiable
- Fusion records must include proper DID attribution
- ZKP mint requests must include valid DID verification

### Audit Trail Completeness
- Every fusion cycle action must generate audit trail entries
- Timestamps must be consistent and tamper-evident
- Cross-references between components must be verifiable
- Export systems must preserve complete metadata
