## Phase X-FED Step 2: Federation Proposal Lifecycle & ZKP Overlay

### Build Objective
Extend the Federation DAO framework by enabling genesis badgeholders to submit, verify, vote on, and audit proposals through a tiered, zero-knowledge-compliant proposal flow.

### Core Implementation Targets

#### 1. FederationProposalSubmit.tsx
- **Location**: `/client/src/components/federation/`
- **Purpose**: ZKP-gated proposal composer with metadata + intent hash
- **Features**:
  - Genesis badgeholder verification and authorization
  - Proposal metadata composition with CID binding
  - Intent hash generation for verification integrity
  - ZKP validation integration with existing proof systems
  - Real-time submission feedback and status tracking

#### 2. FederationProposalReview.tsx
- **Location**: `/client/src/components/federation/`
- **Purpose**: Badgeholder review pane with real-time sentiment and reputation streak overlays
- **Features**:
  - Real-time proposal review interface with sentiment analysis
  - Reputation streak overlay integration from /deck/10
  - Multi-badgeholder review aggregation and consensus tracking
  - Interactive review submission with ZKP verification
  - Cross-deck sentiment synchronization

#### 3. FederationZKVotePanel.tsx
- **Location**: `/client/src/components/federation/`
- **Purpose**: Encrypted voting interface with TP-weighted consensus visibility
- **Features**:
  - ZKP-encrypted vote submission with privacy preservation
  - Truth Points weighted consensus calculation and display
  - Real-time vote aggregation with encrypted ballot tracking
  - Tier-based voting power visualization and verification
  - Anonymous ballot confirmation with cryptographic proof

#### 4. FederationProposalAudit.tsx
- **Location**: `/client/src/components/federation/`
- **Purpose**: Final ZKP-verifiable result screen with DID trace and CID-linked badge verification
- **Features**:
  - Complete proposal lifecycle audit trail with DID tracking
  - CID-linked badge verification through TruthCoins.sol guardian map
  - ZKP result verification and cryptographic proof display
  - Final consensus calculation with tier-weighted results
  - Audit export functionality with comprehensive metadata

#### 5. FederationRouter.tsx
- **Location**: `/client/src/components/federation/`
- **Purpose**: Route management for federation proposal workflows
- **Routes**:
  - `/federation/proposal/submit` - Proposal submission interface
  - `/federation/proposal/review/:id` - Proposal review interface
  - `/federation/proposal/vote/:id` - ZKP voting interface
  - `/federation/proposal/audit/:id` - Final audit results display

## Integration Specifications

### CID-Binding Integration
- TruthCoins.sol guardian map integration for proposal verification
- Permanent CID assignment for proposal permanence and integrity
- Cross-reference with existing Genesis badge system

### ZKP Verification Integration
- Reuse existing ZKP infrastructure from /deck/2 (GovernanceDeck)
- Integration with /zkp/mint proof generation systems
- Enhanced privacy preservation for federation-level proposals

### Cross-Deck Integration
- Reputation and sentiment overlays from /deck/10 (RepresentativeFeedback)
- Cross-deck voting synchronization with Governance/Privacy/Audit decks
- DAO proposal anchoring via DAOBroadcastEmitter.ts

### Accessibility & Mobile Compliance
- Complete ARIA compliance with screen reader support
- Mobile responsive design with ≤460px breakpoint optimization
- 48px+ tap targets and stable layout validation

```
1. Submission → FederationProposalSubmit.tsx
   ├── Genesis badgeholder verification
   ├── ZKP proof generation
   ├── CID binding via TruthCoins.sol
   └── DAOBroadcastEmitter integration

2. Review → FederationProposalReview.tsx
   ├── Multi-badgeholder sentiment analysis
   ├── Reputation streak overlay
   ├── Cross-deck synchronization
   └── Review aggregation

3. Voting → FederationZKVotePanel.tsx
   ├── ZKP-encrypted ballot submission
   ├── TP-weighted consensus calculation
   ├── Anonymous verification
   └── Real-time aggregation

4. Audit → FederationProposalAudit.tsx
   ├── Complete lifecycle audit trail
   ├── DID trace verification
   ├── CID-linked badge validation
   └── Final result publication
```

### ZKP Integration Architecture
```

## GROK QA Cycle B Preparation

### QA Validation Requirements:
- 10 submission flows (5 valid/5 invalid)
- 8 vote simulations with encrypted ballot verification
- 3 audit chain verifications with DID trace validation
- 4 guardian mismatch traps for security testing

### Integration Testing:
- Cross-deck sentiment synchronization validation
- ZKP proof chain integrity verification
- CID binding and TruthCoins.sol integration testing
- Performance target validation under load
