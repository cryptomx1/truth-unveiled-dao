## Phase X-Z Step 1: International Replication Framework

### Build Objective
Create comprehensive global deployment toolkit enabling Truth Unveiled Civic Genome replication across international jurisdictions with localization support, cultural adaptation frameworks, and multi-national compliance systems.

### Core Deliverables

#### 1. Global Deployment Engine
- **Location**: `/scripts/global-deployment/`
- **Purpose**: Automated international deployment with localization support
- **Features**:
  - Multi-language content management system
  - Cultural adaptation framework for civic engagement patterns
  - Regional compliance validation (GDPR, local privacy laws)
  - Currency and governance system localization
  - International DID federation protocols

#### 2. Jurisdiction Adaptation Layer
- **Location**: `/shared/jurisdictions/`
- **Purpose**: Country-specific civic system configuration
- **Features**:
  - Legal framework mapping for local governance structures
  - Cultural civic engagement pattern recognition
  - Local representative accountability systems
  - Regional privacy and security compliance
  - Multi-jurisdictional ZKP consensus protocols

#### 3. Cultural Localization Engine
- **Location**: `/client/src/localization/`
- **Purpose**: Deep cultural adaptation beyond language translation
- **Features**:
  - Civic participation style adaptation (individual vs collective focus)
  - Local governance terminology and concepts
  - Cultural color schemes and visual preferences
  - Regional communication patterns and formality levels
  - Time zone and calendar system integration

#### 4. International Federation Protocol
- **Location**: `/server/federation/`
- **Purpose**: Cross-border civic data synchronization and consensus
- **Features**:
  - International DAO consensus mechanisms
  - Cross-jurisdictional TruthCoin exchange protocols
  - Global representative accountability tracking
  - International ZKP verification networks
  - Multi-national policy impact analysis
