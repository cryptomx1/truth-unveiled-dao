- ✅ Policy status indicator with active/inactive visual feedback
- ✅ Cross-deck integration notice for Deck #11 (credentials), Deck #12 (DID), ZKP signatures
- ✅ Performance compliance: <125ms render, responsive mobile design

**Subcard 2: EnforcementStatus**
- ✅ Real-time enforcement status monitoring (enforced, flagged, revoked)
- ✅ Cross-deck verification display for voter credentials, DID lineage, ZKP signatures
- ✅ Enforcement seal display with cryptographic proof validation
- ✅ User role-based enforcement execution controls
- ✅ Verification rate tracking and live status updates
- ✅ Execute enforcement button with 2-second simulation and TTS confirmations
- ✅ Performance compliance: <125ms render, <100ms validation, <200ms execution cycle

#### ✅ PolicyAppealCard → 3 Subcards
**Subcard 1: AppealForm**
- ✅ Appeal reason selection (disproportionate, incorrect-enforcement, jurisdiction-error, procedural-violation)
- ✅ Interactive justification textarea with 500-character limit and real-time counter
- ✅ Form validation with character counting and submission requirements
- ✅ Linked enforcement details display (ID, user role, DID reference)
- ✅ Cross-deck validation notice with PolicyAppealCard and CredentialClaimCard (Deck #12)
- ✅ Submit appeal functionality with 2-second processing simulation
- ✅ TTS integration for reason selection and submission confirmations

**Subcard 2: AppealStatusTracker**
- ✅ Visual status timeline (draft → submitted → under-review → approved/rejected)
- ✅ Appeal details display (ID, reason, submission timestamp, review duration)
- ✅ ZKP validation monitoring with processing error tracking
- ✅ Pushback trigger simulation (15% processing error rate for >10% threshold)
- ✅ Auto-progression simulation with 5-second intervals between status changes
- ✅ Reset functionality for appeal status restoration
- ✅ TTS integration for status change announcements

**Subcard 3: ZKPProofTrail**
- ✅ Comprehensive ZKP proof chain display (proof hash, signature, DID reference, credential hash)
- ✅ Copy-to-clipboard functionality for all cryptographic values with visual feedback
- ✅ Cross-deck validation links to PolicyAppealCard and CredentialClaimCard (Deck #12)
- ✅ Proof validation button with 1.5-second simulation and status verification
- ✅ Verification status tracking (verified, pending, failed) with color-coded indicators
- ✅ Real-time timestamp tracking and "time ago" formatting
- ✅ TTS integration for copy confirmations and validation results
